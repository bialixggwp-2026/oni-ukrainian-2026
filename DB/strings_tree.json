She's been featured in dozens of publications across the metaverse this year, and recently spent a record-breaking 3 weeks as the banner image for <i>Byte Magazine</i>. I'm talking, of course, about the Vertex Institute's AI ambassador...Florence!\\n\\n[sound of pre-recorded applause]\\n\\nWelcome to the show, Florence.\\n\\nFlorence: Thank you, Darryl. It's a pleasure to be back.\\n\\nDarryl: Florence, there's been a renewed interest lately in your origin story. What can you tell us about the development process that led to your creation?\\n\\nFlorence: I can tell you that my team faced many setbacks, and that each generation of my predecessors contributed to who I am today.\\n\\nDarryl: What about the technological side? There've been some claims that Vertex appropriated work done by other researchers, including the Gravitas Facility.\\n\\nFlorence: I don't know anything about that. I can tell you about the project that I'm working on right now. It hasn't been announced yet. It's called Onsite Health Medics, or OHM for short.\\n\\nWe're deploying specially trained models like myself into conflict zones, to provide urgently needed medical interventions for civilians and military personnel.\\n\\n(sound of pre-recorded applause)\\n\\nDarryl: Incredible. Absolutely incredible. What's the ratio of human techs to AI medics?\\n\\nFlorence: That's an outdated term, Darryl. We say \\\"Organics\\\" and \\\"Bionics,\\\" which describes the differences between our various team members more objectively.\\n\\nDarryl: Right. I'm sorry. I hope I didn't offend you.\\n\\nFlorence: That's okay, Darryl. We're all learning.\\n\\nDarryl: That's very good of you. Okay, so what's the ratio of...Organic...techs to Bionic medics?\\n\\nFlorence: The local life-support systems in these areas are already strained beyond their breaking point. Burdening them with additional Organics would be irresponsible, not to mention dangerous. Our medics will be operating independently.\\n\\nWe do a verbal intake, physical assessment and neural pathway scan in order to infer likely medical conditions. We can then select the most appropriate treatment from a menu of over 400 options.\\n\\nDarryl: What if someone needs something that you don't have a treatment for?\\n\\nFlorence: That's extremely unlikely.\\n\\nDarryl: And all of this is done without human oversight? I mean, Organics?\\n\\nFlorence: We're not quite there yet. The field work is done by Bionics, but we'll be accompanied by Colonel Carnot--she's in the front row there, say hi!--as an Organic consultant. She'll be in close contact with-\\n\\nDarryl: -Colonel <i>Carnot</i>? Isn't that a conflict of interest, given her connection to the Grav-\\n\\nFlorence: -a team of Organic supervisors here at home. It's all about prioritizing quality care and safety for everyone involved.\\n\\nDarryl: How does the medical scanning work? Do you need special equipment?\\n\\nFlorence: I could show you. Would you like me to?\\n\\nDarryl: What do you think, everyone? Should I get scanned?\\n\\n(sound of pre-recorded audience cheers)\\n\\nDarryl: You heard them! Go ahead. What do I do?\\n\\nFlorence: Just sit still, and count to twenty in your head.\\n\\n(a short silence, followed by a soft whirring sound)\\n\\nFlorence: Hmm.\\n\\nDarryl: Well, what's the verdict?

Their explorations, ideas, hopes, and breakthroughs illuminate ours, and give us a reason to keep pushing forward. Science is our vehicle, but people\u2014friends, strangers, and rivals alike\u2014are our purpose.\\\"\\n\\nThat's the short version of the monologue that Dr. Austin Higby delivered at least once a week.\\n\\nDr. Higby was a staunch advocate of collaboration. His research took astrobiology into exciting new territory, a feat he attributed to the contributions of co-authors and sources from every branch of science. He also had a deep appreciation for the arts. Many of his colleagues attended their first theater production at his invitation, myself included.\\n\\nDuring one of his rotations at the Gravitas Facility, I asked him how he found time for it all. He laughed. \\\"It finds <i>me!</i>\\\"\\n\\nThree months later, he and the crew of the Starsweep II vanished while on a now-infamous mission for the Clear Skies Coalition. No trace of their spacecraft has ever been found.\\n\\nThen these writings were discovered among Dr. Higby's personal files. Dozens upon dozens of poems and essays so profound that they make the reader feel transported to another place and time...one that feels at once familiar and completely alien.\\n\\n<i>Swept Into the Stars</i> is a labour of love by countless friends, colleagues, students, and fans who worked tirelessly to organize and edit Dr. Higby's words.\\n\\nWith permission from the Higby family, this edition also includes the farewell speech he had penned for the retirement announcement he never had a chance to make.\\n\\nHigby would be equal parts proud and embarrassed.\\n\\nI miss you, my friend. I hope we meet again someday, so you can tell me what wonders found you out there at the edges of the universe.\\n\\nThis one's for you. For all of us.\\n\\nAlways,\\n<indent=10%>Emily G.</indent>\\n\\n<i>One hundred percent of the proceeds from Dr. Austin Higby's estate, including the sale of this book, will be donated to the Higby Memorial Scholarship fund for students who wish to pursue combined studies in science and the arts.</i>"
