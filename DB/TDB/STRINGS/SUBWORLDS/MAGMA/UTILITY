<link=\"MAGMA\">Magma</link> is source of extreme <link=\"HEAT\">Heat</link> which can be used to transform <link=\"WATER\">Water</link> in to <link=\"STEAM\">Steam</link> or <link=\"CRUDEOIL\">Crude Oil</link> into <link=\"PETROLEUM\">Petroleum</link>. In order to prevent the extreme temperatures of this biome invading other parts of my base, suitable insulation must be constructed using materials with high melting points like <link=\"CERAMIC\">Ceramic</link> or <link=\"OBSIDIAN\">Obsidian</link>.\n\nThough exosuits such as <link=\"ATMOSUIT\">Atmo Suits</link> and <link=\"JETSUIT\">Jet Suits</link> will provide some protection for my Duplicants, there is still a danger they will overheat if spending an extended amount of time in this Biome. I should ensure that suitable medical facilities have been constructed nearby to take care of any medical emergencies.
