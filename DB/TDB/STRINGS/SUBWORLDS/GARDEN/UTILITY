This biome is home to <link=\"STEGOSPECIES\">Lumbs</link>, which assist in harvesting edible plants, and pollinator <link=\"BUTTERFLYSPECIES\">Mimikas</link> which boost plant growth speeds.\n\n<link=\"POWER\">Power</link> systems built in this biome will benefit from <link=\"NICKELORE\">Nickel Ore</link> and <link=\"PEAT\">Peat</link> deposits, and with plenty of <link=\"SHALE\">Shale</link> available, there is no lack of construction materials.\n\nColonists can rely on <link=\"GARDENFORAGEPLANTPLANTED\">Snactus</link> plants for life-sustaining calories in their early days. <link=\"VINEMOTHER\">Ovagro Nodes</link> become efficient <link=\"FOOD\">Food</link> crops when permitted to grow to their full extent, as their <link=\"WATER\">Water</link> requirements do not increase with the number of <link=\"VINEFRUIT\">Ovagro Fig</link>-bearing vines.\n\nNew colonies should be able to survive here with relative ease.
