Though <link=\"OXYGEN\">Oxygen</link> is more scarce in this biome, it's the perfect place to cultivate flora and fauna that thrive in CO2, such as <link=\"OILFLOATERSPECIES\">Slicksters</link>. These critters can be domesticated as a renewable source of <link=\"CRUDEOIL\">Crude Oil</link>.\n\n<link=\"DIAMOND\">Diamond</link> deposits can occasionally be found in the Oily biome, which will require a Duplicant with the <link=\"MINING3\">Super-Duperhard Digging</link> skill to explore properly.\n\n<link=\"EVILFLOWER\">Sporechids</link> are beautiful, but should only be approached if a Duplicant is properly <link=\"EQUIPMENT\">equipped</link>.\n\nWhile the dangers of this biome should not be underestimated, the benefits <link=\"CRUDEOIL\">Crude Oil</link> and <link=\"PETROLEUM\">Petroleum</link> will bring to my colony far outweigh the risks.
