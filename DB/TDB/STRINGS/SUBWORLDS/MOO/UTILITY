In addition to <link=\"METHANE\">Natural Gas</link>, the highly toxic <link=\"CHLORINEGAS\">Chlorine</link> is also present in gas form. In fact, Chlorine is present here in <link=\"ELEMENTSGAS\">gas</link>, <link=\"ELEMENTSLIQUID\">liquid</link>, and <link=\"ELEMENTSSOLID\">solid</link> states, largely due to the presence of <link=\"BLEACHSTONE\">Bleach Stone</link>.\n\n<link=\"IGNEOUSROCK\">Igneous Rock</link> and its denser form, <link=\"GRANITE\">Granite</link>, provide some useful construction materials, but the real star of this biome are the <link=\"MOO\">Gassy Moos</link> who consume <link=\"GASGRASS\">Gas Grass</link> and excrete <link=\"METHANE\">Natural Gas</link>. While Gassy Moos cannot be bred domestically, Gassy Mooteors regularly fall from space onto this biome, making it the best way to find a reliable source of these elusive creatures.\n\nWith no breathable <link=\"OXYGEN\">Oxygen</link> in this biome my Duplicants will need to be properly prepared before they venture too far into its depths.
