<link=\"SWAMPFORAGEPLANTPLANTED\">Swamp Chard</link> can provide adequate nutrients for my Duplicants while they establish farms, but it cannot be planted or propogated. <link=\"SWAMPHARVESTPLANT\">Bog Buckets</link>, however, provide a sweet source of nutrients that are fairly easy to farm using <link=\"DIRTYWATER\">Polluted Water</link> and require no extra light to grow.\n\nFortunately <link=\"DIRTYWATER\">Polluted Water</link> is abundant in this biome and will require a <link=\"WATERPURIFIER\">Water Sieve</link> to turn into something my Duplicants can drink. Additionally my Duplicants can use a <link=\"SLUDGEPRESS\">Sludge Press</link> to filter clean water from <link=\"MUD\">Mud</link> (NOTE: <link=\"TOXICMUD\">Polluted Mud</link>, however, does not make clean water).\n\nMeanwhile, rudimentary power can be gained from the energy producing <link=\"STATERPILLAR\">Plug Slugs</link> that inhabit this biome.\n\nShiny <link=\"COBALTITE\">Cobalt Ore</link> can be found here, providing a adequate source of metal.\n\nWhile much of this biome is dangerous for a new colony with some deliberate research and careful planning my Duplicants can not only survive but thrive here.
