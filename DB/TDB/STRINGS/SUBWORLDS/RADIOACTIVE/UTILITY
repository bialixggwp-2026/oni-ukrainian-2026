<link=\"LEADSUIT\">Lead Suits</link> are imperative if my Duplicants are going to start exploring this biome as <link=\"RADIATIONSICKNESS\">Radioactive Contaminants</link> are a constant danger here.\n\n<link=\"BEE\">Beetas</link> pose a double threat as they are both highly radioactive and very aggressive. If they can be subdued, <link=\"BEEHIVE\">Beeta Hives</link> provide a great service turning <link=\"URANIUMORE\">Uranium Ore</link> into <link=\"ENRICHEDURANIUM\">Enriched Uranium</link>.\n\nWhile the Radioactive Biome, and the Beetas contained within it, should be avoided at all costs if my Duplicants do not have the correct protection, my colony will need to trek into this dangerous biome if we are going to build any higher-tier nuclear technologies.
