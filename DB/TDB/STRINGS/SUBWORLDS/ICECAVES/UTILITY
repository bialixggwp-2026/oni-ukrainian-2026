The below-freezing climate in this biome keeps elements frozen solid, but once a colony has established the means necessary to melt the abundant <link=\"ICE\">Ice</link> deposits, it should be able to produce enough <link=\"WATER\">Water</link> to meet its needs. Initial scans reveal the presence of <link=\"CINNABAR\">Cinnabar Ore</link> that can be used in <link=\"POWER\">Power</link> systems.\n\n<link=\"STABLESNOW\">Snow</link> is a readily available construction material. Note that its structural integrity may be undermined if surrounding areas become hot enough to trigger a state change.\n\n<link=\"HARDSKINBERRY\">Pikeapple Bushes</link> feed both Duplicants and the native <link=\"WOODDEER\">Flox</link>, a critter whose <link=\"WOOD\">Wood</link>, antlers offer a renewable source of fuel and attractive temperature-stable construction materials.\n\nAlthough pockets of <link=\"OXYGEN\">Oxygen</link> allow Duplicants to begin the work of colony-building in this biome, the key to long-term survival is the cultivation of <link=\"BLUEGRASS\">Alveo Vera</link> plants. They produce harvestable <link=\"OXYROCK\">Oxylite</link> and their beauty--much like that of the dreamy <link=\"ICEFLOWER\">Idylla Flower</link>--is a wonderful salve for existential dread.
