Far from devoid of life, this biome contains some much needed plant life, ripe for cultivation. <link=\"COLDWHEAT\">Sleet Wheat</link> provides a nutrient rich ingredient for creating complex foods, though the plants do require sub-zero temperatures to thrive.\n\nFortunately <link=\"COLDBREATHER\">Wheezewort</link> can been planted on farms to lower surrounding temperatures.\n\nCrucially, small deposits of <link=\"WOLFRAMITE\">Wolframite</link> have been detected here. This is an extremely rare metal that should be preserved for <link=\"TUNGSTEN\">Tungsten</link> production.\n\nThough my Duplicants appear more than happy to work in the Tundra Biome for short periods of time, I will need to provide proper <link=\"EQUIPMENT\">equipment</link> for them to avoid adverse affects to their well-being if they are working here for longer periods.
