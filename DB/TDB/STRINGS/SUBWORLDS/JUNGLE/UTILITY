The <link=\"DRECKOSPECIES\">Drecko</link> is a relatively benign critter which can be domesticated to aid in textile and food production.\n\nThe <link=\"GLOMSPECIES\">Morb</link>'s only function is to produce <link=\"POLLUTEDOXYGEN\">Polluted Oxygen</link> which may be useful when establishing sustainable production loops with other critters.\n\n<link=\"SWAMPLILY\">Balm Lilies</link> would be useful to cultivate for the production of critical medical materials.\n\n<link=\"SPICEVINE\">Pincha Pepperplants</link> greatly improve the nutritional value and quality of a colony's food supply. Because of their unique relationship with gravity, the plants must be orientated upside-down for proper growing. This can be accomplished by using a <link=\"FARMTILE\">Farm Tile</link>.\n\nGiven the toxic gases I will have to build a proper <link=\"BUILDCATEGORYHVAC\">Ventilation</link> system to both protect my Duplicants and provide the optimum environments for the native plants and critters.
