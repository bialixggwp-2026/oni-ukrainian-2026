The layers of sedimentary rock are predominantly made up of <link=\"GRANITE\">Granite</link> deposits, although <link=\"OBSIDIAN\">Obsidian</link> and <link=\"IGNEOUSROCK\">Igneous Rock</link> are also present. This suggests a history of volcanic activity, though no volcanoes exist here currently.\n\nVeins of <link=\"IRON\">Iron Ore</link> deposits are evident from initial scans, as are deposits of <link=\"CARBON\">Coal</link>. Both are useful in setting up a colony's power infrastructure.\n\nThough it lacks the crucial resources necessary to sustain a colony, there is nothing inherently dangerous here to harm my Duplicants. It should be safe enough to explore.
