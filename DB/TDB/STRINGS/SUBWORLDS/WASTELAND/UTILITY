The prevalance of <link=\"COPPER\">Copper</link>, <link=\"SANDSTONE\">Sandstone</link>, <link=\"IGNEOUSROCK\">Igneous Rock</link> and its <link=\"IRON\">Iron</link>-rich counterpart <link=\"MAFICROCK\">Mafic Rock</link>, make this a fruitful biome to explore for construction material. <link=\"SAND\">Sand</link> is also in abundance here which is useful as a filtering material.\n\nWhile the wildlife is not in abundance in the Wasteland Biome, the <link=\"DIVERGENTBEETLE\">Sweetle</link> and <link=\"DIVERGENTWORM\">Grubgrub</link> make interesting creatures to domesticate as they co-exist with the <link=\"WORMPLANT\">Grubfruit Plants</link> to produce a much higher quality food than the <link=\"WORMPLANT\">Spindly Grubfruit Plant</link> found in the wild. Additionally, the <link=\"SULFUR\">Sulfur</link> found here works both as food for the GrubGrubs and fertilizer for the Grubfruit Plants.\n\nThe abundance of <link=\"OXYGEN\">Oxygen</link> found in the Wasteland Biome makes for a low-risk area to send my Duplicants into to collect useful resources to continue with their construction projects.
