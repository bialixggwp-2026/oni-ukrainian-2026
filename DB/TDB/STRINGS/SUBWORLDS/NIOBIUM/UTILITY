By itself, <link=\"NIOBIUM\">Niobium</link> is not a particularly useful resource. But if processed through a <link=\"SUPERMETALREFINERY\">Molecular Forge</link>, it produces the extremely thermal conductive <link=\"TEMPCONDUCTORSOLID\">Thermium</link>, which goes a long way in solving many extreme temperature issues in a colony.\n\nThe edges of this biome are filled with <link=\"OBSIDIAN\">Obsidian</link> so a Duplicant with the <link=\"MINING3\">Super-Duperhard Digging</link> skill will be required before my colony can explore here.
