Initially there is very little solid ground in this biome to establish a temporary base, but once a transportation network can be established to send the <link=\"WATER\">Water</link> of the Aquatic Biome to the rest of the colony, the other elements will be easier to reach.\n\n<link=\"SANDSTONE\">Sandstone</link>, <link=\"MAFICROCK\">Mafic Rock</link>, <link=\"SAND\">Sand</link> and <link=\"SEDIMENTARYROCK\">Sedimentary Rock</link> provide readily available construction materials for setting up elementary infrastructure. The presence of <link=\"OXYROCK\">Oxylite</link> provides invaluable <link=\"OXYGEN\">Oxygen</link> which, through careful planning, should be able to sustain any Duplicants working in the area for a limited amount of time.
