Small pockets of <link=\"OXYROCK\">Oxylite</link> and <link=\"WATER\">Water</link> are present in the Forest Biome, but calculations reveal they will only sustain the colony for a limited time.\n\nAnalysis shows two native plants which should be prioritized for cultivation: The <link=\"OXYFERN\">Oxyfern</link>, which releases <link=\"OXYGEN\">Oxygen</link> but requires <link=\"WATER\">Water</link>; and the <link=\"FORESTTREE\">Arbor Tree</link> which provides <link=\"WOOD\">Wood</link> as a fuel source.\n\nA symbiotic relationship exists with the <link=\"FORESTTREE\">Arbor Tree</link> and the native <link=\"SQUIRRELSPECIES\">Pips</link> which appear to be the only critter that can find the elusive <link=\"PLANTS\">Arbor Acorns</link>.\n\nThis biome is really quite beautiful. I've noted that <link=\"LIGHTBUGSPECIES\">Shine Bugs</link> and <link=\"LEAFYPLANT\">Mirth Leaf</link> both evoke feelings of serenity in my Duplicants.
