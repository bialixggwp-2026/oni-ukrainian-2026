Marsh Biomes contain large amounts of <link=\"SLIMEMOLD\">Slime</link> which can be converted into <link=\"ALGAE\">Algae</link> and provide a valuable resource for growing <link=\"MUSHROOMPLANT\">Dusk Caps</link> as well as feeding to <link=\"PACUSPECIES\">Pacus</link> for producing some higher tier <link=\"FOOD\">food</link>.\n\nBecause of the high degree of probability that this biome will infect my Duplicants with <link=\"SLIMELUNG\">Slimelung</link>, it may be prudent to limit access to this area to essential activities only until my Duplicants are able to set up suitable protection.
