The pathogen-fueled guidebot is designed to maximize a colony's chances of surviving in hostile environments by meeting three core outcomes:\n\n1. Filtration and removal of toxins from environment;\n2. Safe disposal of filtered toxins through conversion into usable biofuel;\n3. Creation of geo-exploration equipment for colony expansion with minimal colonist endangerment.\n\nThe elements aggregated during this process may result in the unintentional spread of contaminants. Specialized training required for safe handling.
