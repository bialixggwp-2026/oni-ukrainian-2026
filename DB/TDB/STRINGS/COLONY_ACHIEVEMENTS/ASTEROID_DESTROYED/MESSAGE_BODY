We've blasted Demolior into oblivion! My colony is safe for now.\n\nAmong the impactor's remains, I've identified several useful resources as well as a small, familiar object... How did such a thing find its way onto an uninhabited asteroid? I have always hoped that other worlds existed... Perhaps they do, and we are more alike than I ever imagined.\n\nThere is so much we have yet to discover.\n
