Success! My Duplicants have restored the plumbing system for the geothermal heat pump.\n\nWe can now use this building to pump liquids out to the connected geo vents. Constructing steam turbines at the venting sites will enable us to convert the resulting steam into power.\n\nThe vents also emit various byproducts. I'm sure I can find a use for them.
