My Duplicants have successfully cleared the obstructed geo vent!\n\nWe can now maximize the full potential of this formidable heat and power source...and perhaps experiment with input temperatures to produce more interesting secondary byproducts.\n\nMy Duplicants seem keen to commemorate this accomplishment by keeping the obstruction as something of a trophy.
