Ice is a class of materials made up mostly (if not completely) of <link=\"WATER\">Water</link> in a frozen or partially frozen form.\n\nAs a material in a frigid solid or semi-solid state, these elements are very useful as a low-cost way to cool the environment around them.\n\nWhen heated, ice will melt into its original liquified form (ie.<link=\"BRINEICE\">Brine Ice</link> will liquify into <link=\"BRINE\">Brine</link>). Each ice element has a different freezing and melting point based upon its composition and state.
