Filtration mediums are materials used to separate purified <link=\"ELEMENTSGAS\">gases</link> or <link=\"ELEMENTSLIQUID\">liquids</link> from their polluted forms.\n\nThey are consumables that will be transformed by the filtering process. For example, <link=\"SAND\">Sand</link> that has been used to filter <link=\"DIRTYWATER\">Polluted Water</link> will become <link=\"TOXICSAND\">Polluted Dirt</link>.
