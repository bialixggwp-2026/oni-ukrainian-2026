When connecting pipes for plumbing, it is useful to have the Plumbing Overlay {Hotkey/Overlay6} selected. Each building which requires plumbing must have their Building Intake connected to the Output Pipe from a source such as a Liquid Pump. Liquid Pumps must be submerged in liquid and attached to a power source to function.\n\nBuildings often output contaminated water which must flow out of the building through piping from the Output Pipe. The water can then be expelled through a Liquid Vent, or filtered through a Water Sieve for reuse.\n\nVentilation applies the same principles to gases. Select the Ventilation Overlay {Hotkey/Overlay7} to see how gases are being moved around the colony.
