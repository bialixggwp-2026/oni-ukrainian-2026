Generators are considered \"Producers\" of Power, while the various buildings and machines in the colony are considered \"Consumers\". Each Consumer will pull a certain wattage from the power circuit it is connected to, which can be checked at any time by (ClickType/clicking) the building and going to the Energy Tab.\n\nI can use the Power Overlay {Hotkey/Overlay2} to quickly check the status of all my circuits. If the Consumers are taking more wattage than the Generators are creating, the Batteries will drain and there will be brownouts.\n\nAdditionally, if the Consumers are pulling more wattage through the Wires than the Wires can handle, they will overload and burn out. To correct both these situations, I will need to reorganize my Consumers onto separate circuits.
