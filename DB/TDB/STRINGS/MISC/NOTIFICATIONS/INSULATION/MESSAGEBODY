The temperature of an environment can have positive or negative effects on the well-being of my Duplicants, as well as the plants and critters in my colony. Selecting {Hotkey/Overlay3} will open the Temperature Overlay where I can check for any hot or cold spots.\n\nI can use a Utility building like an Ice-E Fan or a Space Heater to make an area colder or warmer. However, I will have limited success changing the temperature of a room unless I build the area with insulating tiles to prevent cold or warm air from escaping.
