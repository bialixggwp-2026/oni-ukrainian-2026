When constructing buildings, I should always take note of their <link=\"HEAT\">Overheat Temperature</link> and plan their locations accordingly. Maintaining low ambient temperatures and good ventilation in the colony will also help keep building temperatures down.\n\nThe <b>Relative Temperature</b> slider tool in the <b>Temperature Overlay</b> {Hotkey/Overlay3} allows me to change adjust the overlay's color-coding in order to highlight specific temperature ranges.\n\nIf I allow buildings to exceed their Overheat Temperature they will begin to take damage, and if left unattended, they will break down and be unusable until repaired.
