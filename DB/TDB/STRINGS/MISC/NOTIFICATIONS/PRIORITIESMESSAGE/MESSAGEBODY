Duplicants will choose where to work based on the priority of the errands that I give them. I can open the <b>Priorities Screen</b> {Hotkey/ManagePriorities} to set their <style=\"KKeyword\">Duplicant Priorities</style>, and the <b>Priority Tool</b> {Hotkey/Prioritize} to fine tune <style=\"KKeyword\">Building Priority</style>. Many buildings will also let me change their Priority level when I select them.
