• I can use {Hotkey/AnalogCamera} to pan my view.\n\n• {Hotkey/ZoomIn} lets me zoom in, and {Hotkey/ZoomOut} zooms out.\n\n• I can speed or slow my perception of time using the top left corner buttons, or by pressing {Hotkey/CycleSpeed}. Pressing {Hotkey/TogglePause} will pause the flow of time entirely.\n\n• I'll keep records of everything I discover in my personal DATABASE {Hotkey/ManageDatabase} to refer back to if I forget anything important.
