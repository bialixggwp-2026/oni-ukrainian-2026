Everything a colony needs to get going is found in the ground. Instructing Duplicants to dig out areas means we can find food, mine resources to build infrastructure, and clear space for the colony to grow. I can access the Dig Tool with {Hotkey/Dig}, which allows me to select the area where I want my Duplicants to dig.\n\nDuplicants will need to gain the Superhard Digging skill to mine Abyssalite and the Superduperhard Digging skill to mine Diamond and Obsidian. Without the proper skills, these materials will be undiggable.
