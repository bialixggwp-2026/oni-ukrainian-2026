Duplicants have limited jumping and climbing abilities. They can only climb two tiles high and cannot fit into spaces shorter than two tiles, or cross gaps wider than one tile. I should keep this in mind while placing errands.\n\nTo check if an errand I've placed is accessible, I can select a Duplicant and (ClickType/click) <b>Show Navigation</b> to view all areas within their reach.
