When Duplicants come into contact with various <link=\"DISEASE\">Germs</link>, they'll need to expend points of <link=\"IMMUNE SYSTEM\">Immunity</link> to resist them and remain healthy. If repeated exposes causes their Immunity to drop to 0%, they'll be unable to resist germs and will contract the next disease they encounter.\n\nDoors with Access Permissions can be built from the BASE TAB<color=#F44A47> <b>[1]</b></color> of the <link=\"MISC\">Build menu</link> to block Duplicants from entering biohazardous areas while they recover their spent immunity points.
