<indent=5%>Omg, <i>hi</i> Nikola!\n\nHave you heard about the super weird thing that's been happening in the kitchen lately? Joshua's lunch has disappeared from the fridge like, every day for the past week!\n\nThere's a <i>ton</i> of cameras in that room too but all anyone can see is like this spiky blond hair behind the fridge door.\n\nSo <i>weird</i> right? ;)\n\nAnyway, totally unrelated, but our computer system's been having this <i>glitch</i> where datasets going back for like half a year get <i>totally</i> wiped for all employees with the initials \"N.T.\"\n\nIsn't it weird how specific that is? Don't worry though! I'm sure I'll have it fixed before it affects any of <i>your</i> work.\n\nByeee!</indent>
