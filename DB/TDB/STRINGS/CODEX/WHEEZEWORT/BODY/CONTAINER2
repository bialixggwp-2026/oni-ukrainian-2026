Deceptive in appearance, this member of the Cnidaria phylum is in fact an animal, not a plant.\n\nWheezewort cells contain no chloroplasts, vacuoles or cell walls, and are incapable of photosynthesis.\n\nInstead, the Wheezewort respires in a recently developed method similar to amphibians, using its membranous skin for cutaneous respiration.
