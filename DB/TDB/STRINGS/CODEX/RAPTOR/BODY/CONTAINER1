For all their bluster, Rhexes are emotionally sensitive creatures that thrive on positive reinforcement, especially words of affirmation.\n\nThese sightless apex predators have exceptionally acidic gastric juices that kill most known bacteria and toxins, enabling them to safely digest their prey. This protective mechanism renders them susceptible to chronic ulcers if food is not readily available.\n\nThe Rhex's tailfeather can be shorn to harvest fibers for textile production. Rhexes don't mind this - some even enjoy it.
