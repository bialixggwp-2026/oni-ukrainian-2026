If a Duplicant has very high stress values they will experience a Stress Response episode. Each Duplicant has a different Stress Behavior - but all stress responses are bad. After the stress behavior episode is done, the Duplicants stress will reset to a lower value. Though, if the factors causing the Duplicant's high stress are not corrected they are bound to have another stress response episode.\n\n
