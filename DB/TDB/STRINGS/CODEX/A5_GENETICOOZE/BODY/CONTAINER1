[LOG BEGINS]\n\nThe Printing Pod is primed by a synthesized bio-organic concoction the technicians have taken to calling \"Ooze\", a specialized mixture composed of water, carbon, and dozens upon dozens of the trace elements necessary for the creation of life.\n\nThe pod reconstitutes these elements into a living organism using the blueprints we feed it, before finally administering a shock of life.\n\nIt is like any other 3D printer. We just use different ink.\n\nDr. Broussard, signing off.\n\n[LOG ENDS]
