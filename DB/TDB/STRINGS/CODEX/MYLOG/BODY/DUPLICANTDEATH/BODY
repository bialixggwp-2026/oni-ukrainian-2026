I lost my first Duplicant today. Duplicants form strong bonds with each other, and I expect I'll see a drop in morale over the next few cycles as they take time to grieve their loss.\n\nI find myself grieving too, in my way. I was tasked to protect these Duplicants, and I failed. All I can do now is move forward and resolve to better protect those remaining in my colony from here on out.\n\nRest in peace, dear little friend.\n\n
