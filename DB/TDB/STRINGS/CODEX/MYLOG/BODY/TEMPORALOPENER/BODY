In their interplanetary travels throughout this system, my Duplicants have discovered a Temporal Tear deep in space.\n\nCurrently it is too small to send a rocket and crew through, but further investigation reveals the presence of a strange artifact on a nearby world which could feasibly increase the size of the tear if a number of Printing Pods are erected in nearby worlds.\n\nHowever, I've determined that using the Temporal Bow to operate a Printing Pod was what propelled Gravitas down the disasterous path which eventually led to the destruction of our home planet. My calculations seem to indicate that the size of that planet may have been a contributing factor in its destruction, and in all probability opening the Temporal Tear in our current situation will not cause such a cataclysmic event. However, as with everything in science, we can never know all the outcomes of a situation until we perform an experiment.\n\nDare we tempt fate again?
