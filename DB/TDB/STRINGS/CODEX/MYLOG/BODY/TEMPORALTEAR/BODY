My Duplicants' space research has made a startling discovery.\n\nFar, far off on the horizon, their telescopes have spotted an anomaly that I could only possibly call a \"Temporal Tear\". Neutronium is detected in its readings, suggesting that it's related to the Neutronium that encases most of our asteroid.\n\nThough I believe it is through this Tear that we became jumbled within the section of our old planet, its discovery provides a glimmer of hope.\n\nTheoretically, we could send a rocket through the Tear to allow a Duplicant to explore the timelines and universes on the other side. They would never return, and we could not follow, but perhaps they could find a home among the stars, or even undo the terrible past that led us to our current fate.\n\n
