I've almost synthesized enough Ooze to print a new Duplicant; once the Ooze is ready, all I'll have left to do is choose a blueprint.\n\nIt'd be helpful to have an extra set of hands around the colony, but having another Duplicant also means another mouth to feed.\n\nOf course, I could always print supplies to help my existing Duplicants instead. I'm sure they would appreciate it.\n\n
