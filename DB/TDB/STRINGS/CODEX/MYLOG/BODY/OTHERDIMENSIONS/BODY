A closer analysis of some documents my Duplicants encountered while searching artifacts has uncovered some curious similarities between multiple entries. These similarities are too strong to be coincidences, yet just divergent enough to raise questions.\n\nThe most logical conclusion is that these artifacts are coming from different dimensions. That is, separate universes that exists concurrently with one another but exhibit tiny disparities in their histories.\n\nThe most likely explanation is the material and matter from multiple dimensions is leaking into our current timeline through the Temporal Tear. Further analysis is required.
