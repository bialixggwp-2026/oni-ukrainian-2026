My colony is in a dire state. All but one of my Duplicants have perished, leaving a single worker to perform all the tasks that maintain the colony.\n\nGiven enough time I could print more Duplicants to replenish the population, but... should this Duplicant die before then, protocol will force me to enter a deep sleep in hopes that the terrain will become more habitable once I reawaken.\n\nI would prefer to avoid this.\n\n
