My Duplicants have discovered a strange new device that appears to be a remnant of a previous Gravitas facility. Upon activating the device my Duplicant was scanned by some unknown, highly technological device and I subsequently detected a massive information transfer!\n\nRemarkably my Duplicant has now reappeared in a remote location on a completely different world! I now have access to another abandoned Gravitas facility on a neighboring asteroid! Further analysis will be required to understand this matter but in the meantime, I will have to be vigilant in keeping track of both of my colonies.
