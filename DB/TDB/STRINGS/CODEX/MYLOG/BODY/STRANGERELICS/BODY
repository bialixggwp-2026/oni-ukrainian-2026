My Duplicant discovered an intact computer during their latest scouting mission. This should not be possible.\n\nThe target location was not meant to possess any intelligent life besides our own, and what's more, the equipment we discovered appears to originate from the Gravitas Facility.\n\nThis discovery has raised many questions, though it's also provided a small clue; the machine discovered was embedded inside the rock of this planet, just like how I found my Pod.\n\n
