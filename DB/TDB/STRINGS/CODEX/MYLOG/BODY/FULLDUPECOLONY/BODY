I've officially run out of unique blueprints from which to print new Duplicants.\n\nIf I desire to grow the colony further, I'll have no choice but to print doubles of existing individuals. Hopefully it won't throw anyone into an existential crisis to live side by side with their double.\n\nPerhaps I could give the new clones nicknames to reduce the confusion.\n\n
