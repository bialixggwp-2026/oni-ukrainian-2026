My Duplicant's investigations into the surrounding space have yielded some interesting results. We are not alone!... At least on a planetary level. We seem to be in a \"Cluster of Worlds\" - a collection of other planetoids my Duplicants can now explore.\n\nSince resources on this world are finite, I must build the necessary infrastructure to facilitate exploration and transportation between worlds in order to ensure my colony's survival.
