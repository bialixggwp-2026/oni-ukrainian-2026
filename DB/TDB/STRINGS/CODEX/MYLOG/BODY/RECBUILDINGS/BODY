My Duplicants continue to grow and learn so much and I can't help but take pride in their accomplishments. But as their skills increase, they require more stimulus to keep their morale high. All work and no play is making an unhappy colony. \n\nI will have to provide more elaborate recreational activities for my Duplicants to amuse themselves if I want my colony to grow. Recreation time makes for a happy Duplicant, and a happy Duplicant is a productive Duplicant.\n\n
