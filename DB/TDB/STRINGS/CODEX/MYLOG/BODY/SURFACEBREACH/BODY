My Duplicants have done the impossible and excavated their way to the surface, though they've gathered some disturbing new data for me in the process.\n\nAs I had begun to suspect, we are not on the target location but on an asteroid with a highly unusual diversity of elements and resources.\n\nFurther, my Duplicants have spotted a damaged planet on the horizon, visible to the naked eye, that bears a striking resemblance to my historical data on the planet of our origin.\n\nI will need some time to assess the data the Duplicants have gathered for me and calculate the total mass of this asteroid, although I have a suspicion I already know the answer.\n\n
