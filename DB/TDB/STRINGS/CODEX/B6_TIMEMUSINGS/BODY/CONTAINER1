When we discuss Time as a concrete aspect of the universe, not seconds on a clock or perceptions of the mind, it is important first of all to establish that we are talking about a unique dimension that layers into the three physical dimensions of space: length, width, depth.\n\nWe conceive of Real Time as a straight line, one dimensional, uncurved and stretching forward infinitely. This is referred to as the \"Arrow of Time\".\n\nLogically this Arrow can move only forward and can never be reversed, as such a reversal would break the natural laws of the universe. Effect would precede cause and universal entropy would be undone in a blatant violation of the Second Law.\n\nStill, one can't help but wonder; what if the Arrow's trajectory could be curved? What if it could be redirected, guided, or loosed? What if we could create Time's Bow?
