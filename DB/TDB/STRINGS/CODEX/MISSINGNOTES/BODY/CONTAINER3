<indent=5%>Dear Dr. Jones,\nI'm so sorry to bother you again...it's just that I'm absolutely certain that someone has been interfering with my files.\n\nI've noticed several discrepancies since last week's \"glitch.\" For example, responses to my recent employee survey on workplace satisfaction and safety were decrypted, and significant portions of my data and research notes have been erased. I'm even missing a few e-mails.\n\nIt's all quite alarming. Could you or Dr. Summers please investigate this when you have a moment?\n\nThank you so much,\n\n</indent>
