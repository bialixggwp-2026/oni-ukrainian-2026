<indent=5%>Hello Dr. Jones,\n\nHope you are well. Sorry to bother you- I believe that someone may have inappropriately accessed my computer.\n\nWhen I was logging in this morning, the \"last log-in\" pop-up indicated that my computer had been accessed at 2 a.m. My last actual log-in was 6 p.m. And some of my files have gone missing.\n\nThe privacy of my work is paramount. Would it be possible to have someone take a look, please?</indent>
