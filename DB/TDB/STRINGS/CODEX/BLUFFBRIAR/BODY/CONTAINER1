Bluff Briars have formed a symbiotic relationship with a closely related plant strain, the <link=\"PRICKLEFLOWER\">Bristle Blossom</link>.\n\nThey tend to thrive in areas where the Bristle Blossom is present, as the berry it produces emits a rare chemical while decaying that the Briar is capable of absorbing to supplement its own pheromone production.
