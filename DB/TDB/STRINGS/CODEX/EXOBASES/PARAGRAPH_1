Building a rocket first requires constructing a <link=\"LAUNCHPAD\">Rocket Platform</link> and adding modules from the menu. All rockets will require an engine, a nosecone and a Command Module piloted by a Duplicant possessing the <link=\"ROCKETPILOTING1\">Rocket Piloting</link> skill or higher. Note that the <link=\"HABITATMODULESMALL\">Solo Spacefarer Nosecone</link> functions as both a Command Module and a nosecone.\n\n
