Incapacitated Duplicants cannot move or perform errands. They must be rescued by another Duplicant before their health drops to zero. If a Duplicant's health reaches zero they will die.\n\nHealth can be restored slowly over time and quickly through rest at the <link=\"MEDICALCOT\">Triage Cot</link>.\n\n Duplicants are generally more vulnerable to <link=\"DISEASE\">Disease</link> than physical damage.\n\n
