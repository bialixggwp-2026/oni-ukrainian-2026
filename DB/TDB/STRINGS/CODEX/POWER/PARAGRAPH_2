Several buildings can generate power. Duplicants can run on the <link=\"MANUALGENERATOR\">Manual Generator</link> to generate clean power. Once generated, power can be consumed by buildings or stored in a <link=\"BATTERY\">Battery</link> to prevent waste. Any generated power that is not consumed or stored will be wasted. Batteries and Generators tend to produce a significant amount of <link=\"HEAT\">Heat</link> while active.\n\nPower can also be stored in portable <link=\"ELECTROBANK\">Power Banks</link>.\n\n
