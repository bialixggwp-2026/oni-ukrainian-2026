The Alveo Vera's fleshy stems are dotted with small apertures featuring bidirectional valves through which <link=\"CARBONDIOXIDE\">Carbon Dioxide</link> is absorbed and sticky oxygenated waste is secreted.\n\nThe buildup from this respiration cycle crystallizes into <link=\"OXYROCK\">Oxylite</link> ore.\n\nHorticulturists have long been curious about the protective epithelium that prevents the <link=\"OXYROCK\">Oxylite</link> ore from sublimating while on the plant. Unfortunately, it is too fragile to survive handling, and has thus far proven impossible to study.
