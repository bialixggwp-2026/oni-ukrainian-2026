Olivia: What on earth is this?\n\n[An open palm slams papers down on a desk.]\n\nOlivia: These readings show that hundreds of kilograms of Neutronium are building up in the machine every shift. When were you going to tell me?\n\nJackie: I'm handling it.\n\nOlivia: We don't have the luxury of taking shortcuts. Not when safety is on the line.\n\nJackie: I think I'm capable of overseeing my own safety.\n\nOlivia: I-I'm not just concerned about <i>your</i> safety! We don't understand the longterm implications of what we're developing here... the manipulations we conduct in this facility could have rippling effects throughout the world, maybe even the universe.\n\nJackie: Don't be such a fearmonger. It's not befitting of a scientist. Besides, I'll remind you this research has the potential to stop the fuel wars in their tracks and end the suffering of thousands. Every day we spend on trials here delays that.\n\nOlivia: It's dangerous.\n\nJackie: Your concern is noted.\n------------------\n
