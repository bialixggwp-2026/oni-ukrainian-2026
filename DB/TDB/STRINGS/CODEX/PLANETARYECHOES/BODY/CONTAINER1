Olivia: We've double-checked our observational equipment and the computer's warm-up is almost finished. We have precautionary personnel in place ready to start a shutdown in the event of a failure.\n\nOlivia: It's time.\n\nJackie: Right.\n\nJackie: Spin the machine up slowly so we can monitor for any abnormal power fluctuations. We start on \"3\".\n\nJackie: \"1\"... \"2\"...\n\nJackie: \"3\".\n\n[There's a metallic clunk. The baritone whirr of machinery can be heard.]\n\nJackie: Something's not right.\n\nOlivia: It's the container... the atom is vibrating too fast.\n\n[The whir of the machinery peels up an octave into a mechanical screech.]\n\nOlivia: W-we have to abort!\n\nJackie: No, not yet. Drop power from the coolant system and use it to bolster the container. It'll stabilize.\n\nOlivia: But without coolant--\n\nJackie: It will stabilize!\n\n[There's a sharp crackle of electricity.]\n\nOlivia: Drop 40% power from the coolant systems, reroute everything we have to the atomic container! \n\n[The whirring reaches a crescendo, then calms into a steady hum.]\n\nOlivia: That did it. The container is stabilizing.\n\n[Jackie sighs in relief.]\n\nOlivia: But... Look at these numbers.\n\nJackie: My god. Are these real?\n\nOlivia: Yes, I'm certain of it. Jackie, I think we did it.\n\nOlivia: I think we created an infinite energy source.\n------------------\n
