Joshua: Hey Mr. Kraus, I'm passing around the collection pan. Wanna pitch in a couple bucks to get a cake for Ellie?\n\nOtto: Uh... I think I'll pass.\n\nJoshua: C'mon Otto, it's her birthday.\n\nOtto: Alright, fine. But this is all I have on me.\n\nOtto: I don't get why you hang out with her. Isn't she kind of... you know, mean?\n\nJoshua: Even the meanest people have a little niceness in them somewhere.\n\nOtto: Huh. Good luck finding it.\n\nJoshua: Thanks for the cake money, Otto.\n------------------\n
