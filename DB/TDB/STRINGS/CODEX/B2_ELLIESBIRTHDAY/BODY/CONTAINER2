Ellie: Nice cake. I bet it wasn't easy to like, strong-arm everyone into buying it.\n\nJoshua: You know, if you were a little nicer to people they might want to spend more time with you.\n\nEllie: Pfft, please. Friends are about <i>quality</i>, not quantity, Josh.\n\nJoshua: Wow! Was that a roundabout compliment I just heard?\n\nEllie: What? Gross, ew. Stop that.\n\nJoshua: Oh, don't worry, I won't tell anyone. I'm not much of a gossip.
