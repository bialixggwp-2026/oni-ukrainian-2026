The creatures we send with the settlement party will not have the time to evolve and adapt to a new environment, yet each creature has been chosen to play a vital role in colony sustainability and is thus too precious to risk loss.\n\nGeneticist: It follows that each organism we design must be equipped with the tools to survive in as many volatile environments as we are capable of planning for. We should not rely on the Pod alone to replenish creature populations.\n\n[LOG ENDS]
