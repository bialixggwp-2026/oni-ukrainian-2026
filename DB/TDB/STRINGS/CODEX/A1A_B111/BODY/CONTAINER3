I can't believe this! I organized a potluck lunch thinking it would be a nice break but Jackie discovered us as we were setting up and insisted that no one had time for \"fooling around\". Of course, everyone was too afraid to defy 'The Director' and went right back to work.\n\nAll the food was just thrown out. Someone had even brought homemade perogies! Seeing the break room garbage full of potato salad and chicken wings made me even more depressed than before. Those perogies looked so good.\n------------------\n
