I keep finding senseless mistakes from stressed-out lab workers. It's getting dangerous. I'm worried this colony we're building will be plagued with these kinds of problems if we don't prioritize mental health as much as physical health. What's the use of making all these plans for the future if we can't build a better world?\n\nMaybe there's some way I can sneak some prerequisite downtime activities into the Printing Pod without Jackie knowing.\n------------------\n
