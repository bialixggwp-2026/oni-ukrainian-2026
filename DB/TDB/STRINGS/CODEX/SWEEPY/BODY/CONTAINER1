The Sweepy is a domesticated sweeping robot programmed to clean solid and liquid debris. The <link=\"SWEEPBOTSTATION\">Sweepy's Dock</link> will automatically launch the Sweepy, store the debris the robot picks up, and recharge the Sweepy's battery, provided it has been plugged into a power source.\n\nThough the Sweepy can not travel over gaps or uneven ground, it is programmed to feel really bad about this.
