<indent=%5>From the time she was old enough to walk Captain Johannsen dreamed of reaching the sky. Growing up on an air force base she came to love the sound jet engines roaring overhead. At 16 she became the youngest pilot ever to fly a fighter jet, and at 22 she had already entered the space flight program.\n\nFour years later Gravitas nabbed her for an exclusive contract piloting our space shuttles. In her time at Gravitas, Captain Johannsen has logged over 1,000 hours space flight time shuttling and deploying satellites to Low Earth Orbits and has just been named the pilot of our inaugural civilian space tourist program, slated to begin in the next year.\n\nGravitas is excited to have Captain Johannsen in the pilot seat as we reach for the stars...and beyond!</indent>
