<i>Megafrondia Byronalis</i>, commonly known as \"Megafrond,\" is a gigantic plant that dwarfs its surroundings.\n\nIts size is not the only daunting factor in its cultivation: the Megafrond's gigantism is possible thanks to its singular adaptation to cold temperatures and a caustic gas environment that few other living things (including farmers) enjoy.\n\nThese challenges are considered a fair price for bragging rights and a useful grain harvest.
