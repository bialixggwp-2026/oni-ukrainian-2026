Mimika Buds are excellent companion plants that provide a farm with the advantages of beneficial insect presence without the challenges of managing an additional critter population.\n\nInside each tightly wrapped bud is a highly concentrated pool of enzymes and imaginal discs similar to those found in the Lepidoptera insect family.\n\nUnder the right conditions, this unique concoction produces a <link=\"BUTTERFLY\">Mimika</link>, an ephemeral pseudo-insect organism that accelerates growth in neighboring plants before settling into its final seed form.\n\nThe sight of a <link=\"BUTTERFLY\">Mimika</link> never fails to fill a gardener with awe.
