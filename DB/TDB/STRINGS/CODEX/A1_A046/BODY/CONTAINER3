Well, if that isn't just gravy, hm? One of the new hires will be acting as the team lead on my next project.\n\nWhen I first started it wasn't that uncommon to sample a whole rack of test tubes by hand. Now a machine can do hundreds of them in seconds. Who knows what this job will look like in another ten or twenty years. Will I still even be in it?\n------------------\n
