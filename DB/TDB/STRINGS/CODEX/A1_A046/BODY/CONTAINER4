That nice young man who helped me with the door the other day, Mr. Kraus, has been an absolute angel. He's been kind enough to help me with this horrible e-mail system and even showed me how to digitize my research notes. I'm learning a lot. Turns out I wasn't the mentor, I'm the mentee! If that isn't a chuckle. At any rate, I feel like I have a better handle on things around here due to Mr. Kraus' help. Turns out you're never too old to learn something new!\n------------------\n
