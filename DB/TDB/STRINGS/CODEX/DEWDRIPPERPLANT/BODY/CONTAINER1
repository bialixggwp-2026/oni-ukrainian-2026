The Dew Dripper is sometimes referred to as the \"purple starling\" of the plant world for the magnificent feather-like leaves that encircle its base.\n\nThis sculptural plant slow-drips excess sap that coagulates upon contact with air. The resulting globule is so dense that its weight would snap the Dew Dripper's hollow stem if planted in the ground.\n\nNo one has ever been seriously injured by a falling Dewdrip, but it's best not to linger beneath them.
