The Grubfruit Plant exhibits a coevolutionary relationship with the <link=\"DIVERGENTSPECIES\">Divergent</link> species.\n\nThough capable of producing fruit without the help of the Divergent, the <link=\"WORMPLANT\">Spindly Grubfruit</link> is a substandard version of the Grubfruit in both taste and caloric value per cycle.\n\nThe mechanism for how the Divergent inspires Grubfruit Plant growth is not entirely known but is thought to be somehow tied to the infrasonic 'songs' these insects lovingly purr to their plants.
