Dr. Sklodowska's been really nice and welcoming since I started working here. Sometimes she comes and sits with me in the cafeteria. The food she brings from home smells like old feet but she chats with me about what new research papers we're each reading and it's very kind.\n\nShe tells me the fact I got hired without a doctorate means I must be very smart, and management must see something in me.\n\nI'm not sure I believe her but it's nice to hear something that counters little voice in my head anyway.\n------------------\n
