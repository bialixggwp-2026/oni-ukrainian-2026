I'm starting my new job at Gravitas today. I'm... well, I'm nervous.\n\nIt turns out they hired a bunch of new people - I guess they're expanding - and most of them are about my age, but I'm the only one that hasn't done my doctorate. They all call me \"Mister\" Kraus and it's the <i>worst</i>.\n\nI have no idea where I'll find the time to do my PhD while working a full time job.\n------------------\n
