<i>I screwed up so much today.</i>\n\nAt one point I spaced on the formula for calculating the volume of a cone. They must have thought I was completely useless.\n\nThe only time I knew what I was doing was when I helped an older coworker figure out her dumb old email.\n\nPeople say education isn't so important as long as you've got the skills, but there's things my colleagues know that I just <i>don't</i>. They're not mean about it or anything, it's just so frustrating. I feel dumb when I talk to them!\n\nI bet they're gonna realize soon that I don't belong here, and then I'll be fired for sure. Man... I'm still paying off my student loans (WITH international fees), I <i>can't</i> lose this income.\n------------------\n
