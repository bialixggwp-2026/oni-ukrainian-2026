To scan space and see nearby interstellar destinations a <link=\"CLUSTERTELESCOPE\">Telescope</link> must first be built on the surface of a Planetoid. Sending an <link=\"ORBITALRESEARCHCENTER\">Orbital Data Collection Lab</link> into orbit around a Planetoid, and having a <link=\"SCANNERMODULE\">Cartographic Module</link> attached to a rocket can also reveal places on a Starmap.\n\nAlways check engine fuel to determine if your rocket can reach its destination, keeping in mind that rockets can only land on Planetoids with a <link=\"LAUNCHPAD\">Rocket Platform</link> on it. Notably, some modules, like <link=\"SCOUTMODULE\">Rover's Modules</link> and <link=\"PIONEERMODULE\">Trailblazer Modules</link>, can be sent to the surface of a Planetoid from a rocket in orbit.\n\nIf a rocket runs out of fuel before it reaches a viable landing site, it will become stranded.
