The first experiments with establishing a colony off planet were an unmitigated disaster. Without outside help, our current Artificial Intelligence was completely incapable of making the kind of spontaneous decisions needed to deal with unforeseen circumstances. Additionally, the colony subjects lacked the forethought to even build themselves toilet facilities, even after soiling themselves repeatedly.\n\nWhile initial experiments in a lab setting were encouraging, our latest operation on non-Terra soil revealed some massive inadequacies to our system. If this idea is ever going to work, we will either need to drastically improve the AI directing the subjects, or improve the brains of our Duplicants to the point where they possess higher cognitive functions.\n\nGiven the disastrous complications that I could foresee arising if our Duplicants were made less supplicant, I'm leaning toward a push to improve our Artificial Intelligence.\n\nMeanwhile, we will have to send a clean-up crew to destroy all evidence of our little experiment beneath the Ceres' surface. We can't risk anyone discovering the remnants of our failed colony, even if that's unlikely to happen for another few decades at least.\n\n(Sometimes it boggles my mind how much further behind Gravitas the rest of the world is.)
