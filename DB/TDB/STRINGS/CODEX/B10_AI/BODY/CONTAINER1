<smallcaps>[Voice Recognition Initialized]\n[Subject Identified: B111-1]</smallcaps>\n\n[LOG BEGINS]\n\nI made a horrible discovery today while reviewing work on the artificial intelligence programming. It seems Dr. Ali mixed up a file when uploading a program onto a rudimentary robot and discovered that the device displayed the characteristics of what he called \"a puppy that was lost in a teleportation experiment weeks ago\".\n\nThis is unbelievable! Jackie has been hiding the nature of the teleportation experiments from me. What's worse is I know from previous conversations that she knows I would never approve of pursuing this line of experimentation. The societal benefits of teleportation aside, you <i>cannot</i> kill a living being every time you want to send them to another room. The moral and ethical implications of this are horrendous.\n\nI know she has been keeping this information from me. When I searched through the Gravitas database I found nothing to do with these teleportation experiments. It was only because this reference showed up in Dr. Ali's AI paper that I was able to discover what has been happening.\n\nJackie has to be stopped.\n\nBut I know she is beyond reasonable discussion. I hope this is the only thing she is hiding from me, but I fear it is not.\n\n[LOG ENDS]\n\n[LOG BEGINS]\n\nDespite myself, I can't help thinking of the intriguing possiblities this presents for the AI development. It haunts me.\n\nI fear I may be sliding down a slippery slope, at the bottom of which Jackie is waiting for me with open arms.\n\n[LOG ENDS]
