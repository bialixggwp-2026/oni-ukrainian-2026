The Saturn Critter Trap plant is a carnivorous plant that lays in wait for unsuspecting critters to happen by, then traps them in its mouth for consumption.\n\nThe Saturn Trap Plant's predatory mechanism is reflective of the harsh radioactive habitat it resides in.\n\nOnce trapped in the deadly maw of the plant, creatures are gently asphyxiated then digested through powerful acidic enzymes which coat the inner sides of the Saturn Trap Plant's leaves.
