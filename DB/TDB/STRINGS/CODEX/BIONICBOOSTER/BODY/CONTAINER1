Boosters are programming modules designed to improve and expand Bionic Duplicants' abilities.\n\nBoosters consume a significant amount of processing power during access and implementation. Bionic Duplicants can expand their capacity for booster installation by accumulating skill points.\n\nBoosters can be combined to grant a broader range of skills, as well as to counteract bionic bugs that may exist in their original programming.
