No no no no no! It can't be! BANHI ANSARI is here, working on space shuttle thrusters in the robotics lab! As soon as she saw me she called me \"Bubbles\" and told everyone about the time I accidentally inhaled a bunch of fungal spores during lab, blew a big snot bubble out my nose and then sneezed all over Professor Avery! Everyone's calling me \"Bubbles\" instead of \"Doctor\" at work now. Some of them don't even know it's a nickname, but I don't want to correct them and seem rude or anything. Ugh, I can't believe that story followed me here! BANHI RUINS EVERYTHING!\n------------------\n
