HAHAHAHAHA! Bioengineering and Robotics did the test run today and Banhi was securing the live cargo pods when one of the rats squeaked at her. She was so scared, she fell on her butt and TOOTED in front of EVERYONE! They're all calling her \"Pipsqueak\". \"Bubbles\" doesn't seem quite so bad now. Pipsqueak's been a really good sport about it though, she even laughed it off at the time. I think we might actually be friends now? It's weird.\n------------------\n
