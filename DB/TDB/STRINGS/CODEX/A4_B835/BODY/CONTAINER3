I've spent the last few days buried in my work, and I'm actually feeling a lot better. We finally perfected a gene manipulation that controls heat sensitivity in rats. Our test subjects barely even shiver in subzero temperatures now. We'll probably do a testrun tomorrow with Robotics to see how the rats fare in the prototype shuttles we're developing.\n------------------\n
