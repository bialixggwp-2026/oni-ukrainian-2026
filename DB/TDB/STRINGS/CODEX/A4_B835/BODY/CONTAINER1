I started work at a new company called the \"Gravitas Facility\" today! I was nervous I wouldn't get the job at first because I was fresh out of school, and I was so so so pushy in the interview, but the Director apparently liked my thesis on the physiological thermal regulation of Arctic lizards. I'll be working with some brilliant geneticists, bioengineering organisms for space travel in harsh environments! It's like a dream come true. I get to work on exciting new research in a place where no one knows me!\n------------------\n
