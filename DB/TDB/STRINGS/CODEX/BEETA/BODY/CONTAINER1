Beetas are insectoid creatures that enjoy a symbiotic relationship with the radioactive environment they thrive in.\n\nMuch like the honey bee gathers nectar and processes it to honey, the Beeta turns <link=\"URANIUMORE\">Uranium Ore</link> into <link=\"ENRICHEDURANIUM\">Enriched Uranium</link> through a complex process of isotope separation inside the Beeta Hive.\n\nWhen first observing the Beeta's enrichment process, many scientists note with surprise just how much more efficient the cooperative combination of insect and hive is when compared to even the most advanced industrial processes.
