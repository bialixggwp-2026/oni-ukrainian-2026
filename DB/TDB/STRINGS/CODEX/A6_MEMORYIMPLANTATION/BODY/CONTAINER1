[LOG BEGINS]\n\nTraditionally, cloning produces a subject that is genetically identical to the donor but develops independently, producing a being that is, in its own way, unique.\n\nThe pod, conversely, attempts to print an exact atomic copy. Theoretically all neural pathways should be intact and identical to the original subject.\n\nIt's fascinating, given this, that memories are not already inherent in our subjects; however, no cloned subjects as of yet have shown any signs of recognition when introduced to familiar stimuli, such as the donor subject's enclosure.\n\nRefer to Experiment 7D.\n\nRefer to Experiment 7F.
