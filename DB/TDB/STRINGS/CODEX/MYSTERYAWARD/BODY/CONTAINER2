Last night's Worldwide Nanotech Awards has sparked controversy in the scientific community after it was announced that the top prize had been awarded to a project whose details could not be publicly disclosed.\n\nThe highly classified paper was presented to the jury in a closed session by lead researcher Dr. Liling Pei, recipient of the inaugural Gravitas Accelerator Scholarship at the Elion University of Science and Technology.\n\nHead judge Dr. Elias Balko acknowledges that it was unorthodox, but defends the decision. \"We're scientists - it's our job to push boundaries.\"\n\nPei was awarded the coveted Halas Medal, the top prize for innovation in the field.\n\n\"I wish I could tell you more,\" says Pei. \"I'm SO grateful to the WNA for this great honor, and to Dr. Stern for the funding that made it all possible. This is going to change everything about...well, everything.\"\n\nThis is the second time that Pei has made headlines. Last year, the striking young nanoscientist won the Miss Planetary Belle pageant's talent show with a live demonstration of nanorobots weaving a ballgown out of fibers harvested from common houseplants.\n\nPei joins the team at the Gravitas Facility early next month.
