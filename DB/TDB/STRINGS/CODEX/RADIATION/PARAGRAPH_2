Duplicants who are exposed to <link=\"RADIATIONSICKNESS\">Radioactive Contaminants</link> will need to wear protection or they risk coming down with <link=\"RADIATIONSICKNESS\">Radiation Sickness</link>.\n\nSome Duplicants will have more of a natural resistance to radiation, but prolonged exposure will still increase their chances of becoming sick.\n\nConsuming <link=\"BASICRADPILL\">Rad Pills</link> or seafood such as <link=\"COOKEDFISH\">Cooked Seafood</link> or <link=\"SEALETTUCE\">Waterweed</link> increases a Duplicant's radiation resistance, but will not cure a Duplicant's <link=\"RADIATIONSICKNESS\">Radiation Sickness</link> once they have become infected.\n\nOn the other hand, exposure to radiation will kill <link=\"FOODPOISONING\">Food Poisoning</link>, <link=\"SLIMELUNG\">Slimelung</link> and <link=\"ZOMBIESPORES\">Zombie Spores</link> on surfaces (including on Duplicants).\n\n
