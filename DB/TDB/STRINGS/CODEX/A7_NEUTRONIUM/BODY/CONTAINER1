[LOG BEGINS]\n\nDirector: I've determined the substance to be metallic in nature. The exact cause of its formation is still unknown, though I believe it to be something of an autoimmune reaction of the natural universe, a quarantining of foreign material to prevent temporal contamination.\n\nDirector: A method has yet to be found that can successfully remove the substance from an affected object, and the larger implication that two molecularly, temporally identical objects cannot coexist at one point in time has dire implications for all time manipulation technology research, not just the Bow.\n\nDirector: For the moment I have dubbed the substance \"Neutronium\", and assigned it a theoretical place on the table of elements. Research continues.\n\n[LOG ENDS]
