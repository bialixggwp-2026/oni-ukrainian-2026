Spigot Seals are named for the hollow, cone-shaped glabellar protrusion that allows them to siphon nourishment directly from plants into the digestive sac located at the cone's base.\n\nIn order to draw nutritious fluids through this \"straw,\" the Spigot Seal compresses its nasal cavity and pumps its tongue up into its soft palate repeatedly, creating a vacuum.\n\nMealtimes are concluded by lapping at the air to reopen the airways and prevent accidental asphyxiation.\n\nMany handlers enjoy teaching this critter to clap its flippers, only to discover that there is no reliable method of limiting how often or how loudly the behavior is repeated.
