Many things have an effect on the Decor value of a tile. A building's effect is expressed as a strength value and a radius. Often that effect is positive, but many buildings also lower the decor value of an area too. <link=\"PLANTS\">Plants</link>, <link=\"CREATURES\">Critters</link>, and <link=\"BUILDCATEGORYFURNITURE\">Furniture</link> often increase decor while industrial buildings, debris, and rot often decrease it. Duplicants experience the combined decor of all objects affecting a tile.\n\nThe <link=\"PRICKLEGRASS\">Bluff Briar</link> has a decor value of 25 and a radius of 4 tiles. \nThe <link=\"MICROBEMUSHER\">Microbe Musher</link> has a decor value of -15 and a radius of 3 tiles. \nThe result of placing a <link=\"MICROBEMUSHER\">Microbe Musher</link> next to a <link=\"PRICKLEGRASS\">Bluff Briar</link> would be a combined decor value of 10.\n\n
