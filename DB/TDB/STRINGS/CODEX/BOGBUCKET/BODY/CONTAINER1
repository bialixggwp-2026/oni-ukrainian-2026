Bog Buckets get their name from their bucket-like flowers and their propensity to grow in swampy, bog-like environments.\n\nThe flower secretes a thick, sweet liquid which collects at the bottom of the bucket and can be gathered for consumption.\n\nThough not inherently dangerous, the interior of the Bog Bucket flower is so warm and inviting that it has tempted individuals to climb inside for a nap, only to awake trapped in its sticky sap.
