This morning's earthquake was an unusual one. The ground itself moved very little, but the air hummed and lapped at the walls as though it were liquid. It was so brief that I almost wondered if I'd imagined it. Then I noticed the Bow.\n\nIt has thus far been unaffected by seismic disruptions, but in the past few hours there has been a marked increase in the audibility of its machinations and a 0.19 percent decrease in output. I've assigned a technician to investigate. We cannot afford to lose even the smallest amount of power at this stage.\n\nNo one else seems to have noticed anything other than Dr. Ali. He says that the remote research access point project was also affected. It seems that the disruption restarted the entire teleportation system. The monitor is now displaying multiple shipping confirmation messages, despite the target building remaining in the departure dock. Reports show that an unknown number of access point blueprints have been disseminated. One shipment does appear to have reached Ceres, luckily, though it's quite far from the landing site.\n\nDr. Ali's entire team is working to determine how many others exist, and pinpoint their geographic and temporal locations.\n\nI am not optimistic.\n\nThe geologists insist that their equipment has recorded no seismic activity at all for several days.\n\nIt begs the question: What <i>was</i> it, if not an earthquake? Where did this event originate?\n\nDr. Ali quipped that maybe a Bow had malfunctioned in another timeline, which is absurd.\n\nIsn't it?
