Tests are progressing as anticipated and results have exceeded our hopes, particularly in regards to thermal threshold.\n\nComing in \"hot,\" as we used to say!\n\n(cough)\n\nAnyway.\n\nFirst we introduced twelve tons of brackish aquifer water cooled to sixty-five degrees.\n\nThis yielded clean steam, as well as soil, salt and trace minerals. As expected.\n\nOkay, so now we flush the system... Ramp up the temperature in the water tank and run it through at two hundred degrees.\n\n(sound of liquid rushing through pipes)\n\nClear the steam so we can-\n\n(sound of a small clang)\n\nHang on, there's some kind of debris...\n\nWe have to be cautious, one small obstruction in this system could be catastrophi-\n\nWait, are those... <i>oxidized iron</i> nuggets?\n\nBut how...\n\nAll I changed was the tempera-\n\nGet me twelve tons of...uh, oil!\n\nStat!\n\nSorry, <i>please.</i>\n\n[LOG ENDS]\n------------------\n[LOG BEGINS]\n\n(long silence)\n\n(sound of machinery powering down)\n\n...unbelievable.\n\n[LOG ENDS]
