Only no one at the office knows what she's on about.\n\nHow am I meant to explain your absence tomorrow? GEI's going to be absolutely livid. If they back out of this deal, it won't be just the underlings who get laid off.\n\n...What exactly do you think you'll achieve, trapped in space with four strangers for the rest of your miserable existence?\n\nYou're a business man, not a bloody astronaut!\n\nNot to mention there's a <i>war</i> on! Who's to say your ground control team won't be dead within the year?\n\n[Sound of several phones starting to ring off the hook.]\n\nI've got to go. Call me back or I'm going straight to the Board.\n\n[FILE ENDS]
