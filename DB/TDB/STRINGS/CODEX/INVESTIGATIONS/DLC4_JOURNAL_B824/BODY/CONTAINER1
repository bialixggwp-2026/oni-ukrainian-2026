It's been four whole business days since I put on my crisp white Gravitas Facility lab coat for the first time...and I still haven't taken it off! I'm not supposed to wear it outside the lab, but I love it so much! I've worn it home and slept in it every single night. It's a little wrinkled now.\n\nEverybody else's lab coats are also wrinkled, though, and I bet at least ONE other person has ferret fur on theirs too.\n\nNo one else from my program got hired, but I'm already starting to get to know my new colleagues. In the cafeteria today, I offered someone a bite of my fish noodle sandwich, and she said \"Gross, ew! Get that away from me!\"\n\nSo now I know she doesn't like sandwiches!\n\nI was surprised, because she'd been staring since I unwrapped it. Maybe she just liked the starry print on the wrap? It matched the glittery pen on her clipboard. I would LOVE a glittery pen. I wonder if she has extras!\n\n------------------\n\nWow, wow, wow! We were discussing hybrid entanglement today and when I cited my favorite paper on the subject, I learned that one of the scientists on my new team is THE DR. SKLODOWSKA! WHO CO-AUTHORED THAT PAPER!\n\nHer work is the reason I've wanted to be a physicist since I was eight years old! She said she was surprised that I had grasped the concepts at that age. Then she laughed and added, \"I suppose we're both accustomed to age-based assumptions, dear.\"\n\nShe told me to call her Magdalena. I said it out loud three times to make sure I'd remember, and that made her laugh again.\n\nIt was a different kind of laugh than I'm used to. I liked it.\n\n------------------\n\n
