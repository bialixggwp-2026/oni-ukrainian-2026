Director Stern was in my lab when I got in this morning. She was looking at my Chicxhulub asteroid recurrence model. I started to explain that it was just a silly exercise I do when I'm letting other data percolate, but she just handed me a hard drive and told me to run that data through my program.\n\nThe updated graphs were SO wild!\n\nAs soon as everything finished loading, the Director copied everything back onto the hard drive. She said, \"Delete everything,\" and left.\n\nI had no idea she was so interested in theoretical physics games. I wonder if there are enough of us at Gravitas to start a club? I emailed Dr. Sklodowska—I mean, Magdalena—to ask, but she hasn't replied to my other six emails yet so maybe she thinks I'm asking too many questions?\n\nPeople say that a lot. But they're being silly because science is all about inquiry!\n\nI'm going to email the graphs to Magdalena and then delete them, just like the Director said.\n\n------------------\n\n
