Dear Dr. Moreson,\n\nI regret to inform you that your son, Calvin, is to be expelled from Brighthall Science Academy effective immediately.\n\nDuring his brief tenure here, Calvin has proven himself a gifted young man, capable of excelling in all subjects.\n\nUnfortunately, Calvin chooses to apply his intellect to activities of an inflammatory nature.\n\nHis latest breach of conduct involved instigating a vitriolic verbal assault against an esteemed guest speaker from Global Energy Inc. during this morning's Sponsor Celebration assembly. Following this, he orchestrated a school-wide walkout.\n\nWhile we sympathize with the personal challenges that Calvin may face as a refugee scholar from a GEI-occupied nation, the Academy can no longer tolerate these disruptions to our educational environment.\n\nYours,
