The Gravitas Facility has pledged to reduce the number of injuries caused by defunct spacecraft falling to Earth.\n\nThis announcement comes less than a month after historic class action lawsuits left two of the aerospace industry's biggest players reeling.\n\n\"For decades, this community has relied on objects landing in uninhabited areas or being incinerated by the Earth's atmosphere upon reentry,\" said Dr. Jacquelyn Stern, director of the facility. \"That's neither sustainable nor guaranteed.\"\n\nThe uncontrolled reentry of space debris accounts for almost a quarter of all accidental injuries around the world. That number is steadily rising as broadband satellite megaconstellations continue to expand.\n\n\"We're developing a way to break up large, at-risk space objects in the thermosphere so that our team can safely deorbit the remaining fragments.\" Dr. Stern explained.\n\nWhen asked about critiques that Gravitas might use this opportunity to obtain proprietary technology or undertake unauthorized satellite placement, Dr. Stern scoffed. \"Our only agenda is the protection and advancement of the human species.\"\n\nA live-streamed press conference is scheduled for the end of this week.
