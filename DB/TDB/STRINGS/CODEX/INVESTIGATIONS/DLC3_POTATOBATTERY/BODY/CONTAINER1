<smallcaps>[Voice Recognition Initialized]\n[Subject Identified: B577]</smallcaps>\n\n[LOG BEGINS]\n\nA recent conversation with our colleagues over in the electrical engineering department has highlighted exciting potential applications for our crops.\n\nThey're seeking alternative inputs for the new universal power bank prototypes...\n\n...a passing remark about the potato batteries of our youth led to talk of biobatteries and bacterial nanowires.\n\n...tuberous plants are promising candidates for electrochemical batteries. Our lab-grown specimens are distinct from the humble solanum tuberosum in appearance and texture, but some may still function as acidic electrolytes.\n\nThere are so many avenues to investigate, and so little time...\n\n[LOG ENDS]\n------------------\n
