<smallcaps><b>[FILE FRAGMENTATION DETECTED]</b>\n\n[Voice Recognition unavailable]</smallcaps>\n\n[LOG BEGINS]\n\nI've been posted up at the Biowaste Processing and Containment buildings for weeks. Glorified dumpster watch, if I'm honest. Lab techs haul huge steel tanks up the hill once in a while. Nobody stays long. Except the janitor. He comes up twice a week to clean...whatever's behind those doors.\n\nEveryone said private security was easy, safe money. They never mentioned the silent killer: boredom.\n\nNo personal devices allowed on the grounds, so I've been counting things.\n\nThirty-nine leaves on the bush by the sewage sanitation entrance. Seventeen scratches on my CCTV monitor screens. Two paperclips in the drawer.\n\n------------------\n\nThe motion sensors in section 6 went off last night. Everything looked fine on the cameras. I was halfway through counting the ceiling slats. I jogged over to investigate. The area was deserted.\n\nIt felt like I was being watched, but two full sweeps confirmed that I was alone. I reset the sensors and returned to my post.\n\n------------------\n\nThose sensors have gone off every twenty minutes on the past two shifts! I have to get all the way over to section 6 every single time. It's always a false alarm.\n\nI called IT. Nobody answered. Typical.\n\nIn the meantime, I'm stuck running back and forth through the damp smoggy air for nothing.\n\nThe janitor showed up while I was catching my breath. He fished around in his cart and offered me a shirt. He said it was fresh.\n\nI politely declined.\n\n[LOG ENDS]\n\n------------------\n\n
