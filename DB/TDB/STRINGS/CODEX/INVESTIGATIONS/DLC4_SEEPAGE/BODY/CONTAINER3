I woke up a few hours later to Gunderson carefully placing the last kitten into a towel-lined bin in his cart. Cat was already inside, nuzzling her babies.\n\nGunderson wasn't fazed by their weird deformities. He glanced meaningfully toward the locked doors. \"They ain't built those tanks to last,\" he said. Then he draped a second towel over the \"cats\" and wheeled the cart away, whistling.\n\n------------------\n\nIt took three washes to get the goo off my uniform. Ugh.\n\nWhatever's behind those doors, it does <i>not</i> belong out in the world.\n\nShould I...report this? Who would I even report it to? <i>What</i> would I report?\n\n[LOG ENDS]
