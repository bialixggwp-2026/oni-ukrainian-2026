<smallcaps><b>[FILE FRAGMENTATION DETECTED]</b>\n\n[Voice Recognition unavailable]</smallcaps>\n\n[LOG BEGINS]\n\nIt's a cat. That's what's been setting off the sensors. A fat orange stray.\n\nIt was drinking out of a puddle when I came around the corner. No collar. It bolted when I tried to pick it up. Good thing, too, since it's probably riddled with disease.\n\nI need to figure out how to lure it away from the sensors so I can stop running laps.\n\n------------------\n\nThe cat followed the trail of fish sticks all the way to my booth at the edge of the lot.\n\nI put a towel on the floor in the corner for him to sleep on. When I turned around, he was watching from my chair. I tried to wave him off, but he just closed his eyes. I tipped the chair until he slid off onto the towel.\n\n------------------\n\nDr. Byron came through a few hours later. She was nice, but looked more haggard than usual.\n\nCat hid until she left. When he popped his head out from under the desk I could tell by the mayo on his whiskers that my lunch was gone.\n\nI grabbed him to throw him out...and he started purring. Man. He really likes me. Or maybe he just likes mayonnaise.\n\nI wonder what else he likes.\n\n------------------\n\nNow I get to count daily gifts from Cat.\n\nSo far: three mice, nine caterpillars and something that might have been a bird wing. It was bigger than any bird I'd expect Cat to catch.\n\nGunderson, that's the janitor, has been here almost every day since Cat showed up. Not much of a conversationalist, but it's nice to have company.\n\nPlus he cleans up Cat's gifts before the smell gets too bad.\n\n------------------\n\nCat is not a he. He's a <i>she!</i> And a <i>mom.</i>\n\nTwo hours ago, Cat gave birth to a litter...on my lap!\n\nAll three kittens are alive. But they're covered in something unnaturally sticky, and there's something...wrong with them. Two of them have little nubs on their heads, like a tiny horn. The third one has a row of ridges down its back. What on earth??\n\nIt's so freaky. But I can't get up to reach the phone without touching them. I really don't want to touch them.\n\nMy legs are falling asleep. Cat has been purring nonstop and bathing her babies. She can't tell they're little aliens!?\n\n\n\n------------------\n\n
