The newbie's not a newbie at all. She's a multi-PhD commercial space comms satellite engineer on her third major career change. Dr. Maya Tayeh, with a string of acronyms after her name that's almost as long as Higby's.\n\nWorks for one of the major players as a consultant. Private-sector-sized ego to match. But her short-wavelength laser net debris vaporizer does sound more efficient than sending up a manual retrieval crew.\n\nShe calls it the LASSO. Higby's already got a space cowboys theme song in the works.\n\nMission control has some words for us about the debris shields. Glad Higby stopped singing before the call came through.\n\n------------------\n\n
