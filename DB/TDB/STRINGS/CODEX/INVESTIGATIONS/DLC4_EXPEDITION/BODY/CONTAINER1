Assignments came in this morning: I'm officially leading the Gravitas arm of the Clear Skies Coalition.\n\nI requested Higby and Gossmann for my crew. Gossmann might be a little salty about deprioritizing her swarm craft sensor project again, but she'd never let that get in the way.\n\nThe Director said Gossmann's a no-go. Third crew member is some CSC contest winner who pitched the top LEO debris cleanup solution last year. I must have made a face, because the Director arched an eyebrow and asked if I had something to say.\n\nNo, ma'am. I've babysat worse. Just one more eventuality to plan for.\n\nOur space tourism program depends on traveling through LEO and beyond. Plus that's the warmup for resettlement missions.\n\nNot much hope for either of those right now, given that I'm the only one who can dodge all the debris we've left up there. We need an interstellar highway, not cosmic Frogger.\n\n------------------\n\n
