\"Our advancements as a species do not occur in a vacuum. Our success is built on the efforts of those who came before us. Their explorations, ideas, hopes, and breakthroughs illuminate ours, and give us a reason to keep pushing forward. Science is our vehicle, but people—friends, strangers, and rivals alike—are our purpose.\"\n\nThat's the short version of the monologue that Dr. Austin Higby delivered at least once a week.\n\nDr. Higby was a staunch advocate of collaboration. His research took astrobiology into exciting new territory, a feat he attributed to the contributions of co-authors and sources from every branch of science. He also had a deep appreciation for the arts. Many of his colleagues attended their first theater production at his invitation, myself included.\n\nDuring one of his rotations at the Gravitas Facility, I asked him how he found time for it all. He laughed. \"It finds <i>me!</i>\"\n\nThree months later, he and the crew of the Starsweep II vanished while on a now-infamous mission for the Clear Skies Coalition. No trace of their spacecraft has ever been found.\n\nThen these writings were discovered among Dr. Higby's personal files. Dozens upon dozens of poems and essays so profound that they make the reader feel transported to another place and time...one that feels at once familiar and completely alien.\n\n<i>Swept Into the Stars</i> is a labour of love by countless friends, colleagues, students, and fans who worked tirelessly to organize and edit Dr. Higby's words.\n\nWith permission from the Higby family, this edition also includes the farewell speech he had penned for the retirement announcement he never had a chance to make.\n\nHigby would be equal parts proud and embarrassed.\n\nI miss you, my friend. I hope we meet again someday, so you can tell me what wonders found you out there at the edges of the universe.\n\nThis one's for you. For all of us.\n\nAlways,\n<indent=10%>Emily G.</indent>\n\n<i>One hundred percent of the proceeds from Dr. Austin Higby's estate, including the sale of this book, will be donated to the Higby Memorial Scholarship fund for students who wish to pursue combined studies in science and the arts.</i>
