<smallcaps><b>[FILE FRAGMENTATION DETECTED]</b></smallcaps>\n\nDarryl: Welcome to <i>Tomorrow, Today!</i> I'm your host, Darryl Dawn, and it's time to discover tomorrow's tech...today!\n\nOur guest today is someone you know and love. She's been featured in dozens of publications across the metaverse this year, and recently spent a record-breaking 3 weeks as the banner image for <i>Byte Magazine</i>. I'm talking, of course, about the Vertex Institute's AI ambassador...Florence!\n\n[sound of pre-recorded applause]\n\nWelcome to the show, Florence.\n\nFlorence: Thank you, Darryl. It's a pleasure to be back.\n\nDarryl: Florence, there's been a renewed interest lately in your origin story. What can you tell us about the development process that led to your creation?\n\nFlorence: I can tell you that my team faced many setbacks, and that each generation of my predecessors contributed to who I am today.\n\nDarryl: What about the technological side? There've been some claims that Vertex appropriated work done by other researchers, including the Gravitas Facility.\n\nFlorence: I don't know anything about that. I can tell you about the project that I'm working on right now. It hasn't been announced yet. It's called Onsite Health Medics, or OHM for short.\n\nWe're deploying specially trained models like myself into conflict zones, to provide urgently needed medical interventions for civilians and military personnel.\n\n(sound of pre-recorded applause)\n\nDarryl: Incredible. Absolutely incredible. What's the ratio of human techs to AI medics?\n\nFlorence: That's an outdated term, Darryl. We say \"Organics\" and \"Bionics,\" which describes the differences between our various team members more objectively.\n\nDarryl: Right. I'm sorry. I hope I didn't offend you.\n\nFlorence: That's okay, Darryl. We're all learning.\n\nDarryl: That's very good of you. Okay, so what's the ratio of...Organic...techs to Bionic medics?\n\nFlorence: The local life-support systems in these areas are already strained beyond their breaking point. Burdening them with additional Organics would be irresponsible, not to mention dangerous. Our medics will be operating independently.\n\nWe do a verbal intake, physical assessment and neural pathway scan in order to infer likely medical conditions. We can then select the most appropriate treatment from a menu of over 400 options.\n\nDarryl: What if someone needs something that you don't have a treatment for?\n\nFlorence: That's extremely unlikely.\n\nDarryl: And all of this is done without human oversight? I mean, Organics?\n\nFlorence: We're not quite there yet. The field work is done by Bionics, but we'll be accompanied by Colonel Carnot--she's in the front row there, say hi!--as an Organic consultant. She'll be in close contact with-\n\nDarryl: -Colonel <i>Carnot</i>? Isn't that a conflict of interest, given her connection to the Grav-\n\nFlorence: -a team of Organic supervisors here at home. It's all about prioritizing quality care and safety for everyone involved.\n\nDarryl: How does the medical scanning work? Do you need special equipment?\n\nFlorence: I could show you. Would you like me to?\n\nDarryl: What do you think, everyone? Should I get scanned?\n\n(sound of pre-recorded audience cheers)\n\nDarryl: You heard them! Go ahead. What do I do?\n\nFlorence: Just sit still, and count to twenty in your head.\n\n(a short silence, followed by a soft whirring sound)\n\nFlorence: Hmm.\n\nDarryl: Well, what's the verdict? Is it handsome in there, or what?\n\nFlorence: We should take a commercial break.\n\n<b>[FILE ENDS]</b>\n\n-----------\n
