Plug Slugs are fuzzy gastropoda that are able to cling to walls and ceilings thanks to an extreme triboelectric effect caused by friction between their fur and various surfaces.\n\nThis same phenomomen allows the Plug Slug to generate a significant amount of static electricity that can be converted into power.\n\nThe increased amount of static electricity a Plug Slug can generate when domesticated is due to the internal vibration, or contented 'humming', they demonstrate when all their needs are met.
