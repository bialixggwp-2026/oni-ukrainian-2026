While other creatures with the Lumb's low forebrain neuron count rapidly become extinct, these docile creatures are uniquely positioned for survival.\n\nTheir large size and spiny protrusions make them unappealing to most predators. Anecdotal evidence also suggests that smaller species will sometimes adopt orphaned Lumbs.\n\nSome experts theorize that this may be motivated by a desire to benefit from the Lumb's genetic muscular condition (akin to restless leg syndrome), which causes them to regularly pound the earth in such a way as to cause nearby plants to drop desirable foods.
