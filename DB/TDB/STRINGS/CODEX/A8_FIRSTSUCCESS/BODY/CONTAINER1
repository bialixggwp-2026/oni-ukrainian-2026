We've successfully compressed and expanded small portions of time under .03 milliseconds. This proves that time is something that can be physically acted upon, suggesting that our vision is attainable.\n\nAn unintentional consequence of both the expansion and contraction of time is the creation of a \"vacuum\" in the space between the affected portion of time and the much more expansive unaffected portions.\n\nSo far, we are seeing that the unaffected time on either side of the manipulated portion will expand or contract to fill the vacuum, although we are unsure how far-reaching this consequence is or what effect it has on the laws of the natural universe. At the end of all compression and expansion experiments, alterations to time are undone and leave no lasting change.
