Scientists from the recently founded Gravitas Facility have unveiled their first technology prototype, dubbed the \"Temporal Bow\". It is a device which manipulates the 4th dimension to generate infinite, clean and renewable energy.\n\nWhile it may sound like something from science fiction, facility founder Dr. Jacquelyn Stern confirms that it is very much real.\n\n\"It has already been demonstrated that Newton's Second Law of Motion can be violated by negative mass superfluids under the correct lab conditions,\" she says.\n\n\"If the Laws of Motion can be bent and altered, why not the Laws of Thermodynamics? That was the main intent behind this project.\"\n\nThe Temporal Bow works by rapidly vibrating sections of the 4th dimension to send small quantities of mass forward and backward in time, generating massive amounts of energy with virtually no waste.\n\n\"The fantastic thing about using the 4th dimension as fuel,\" says Stern, \"is that it is really, categorically infinite\".\n\nFor those eagerly awaiting the prospect of human time travel, don't get your hopes up just yet. The Facility says that although they have successfully transported matter through time, the technology was expressly developed for the purpose of energy generation and is ill-equipped for human transportation.
