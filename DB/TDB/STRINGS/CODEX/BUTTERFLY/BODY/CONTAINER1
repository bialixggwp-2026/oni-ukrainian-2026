Mimikas are difficult to categorize. Biologists theorize that the <link=\"BUTTERFLYPLANT\">Mimika Bud</link> engages in this rare variation of reproductive mimicry to improve seed-dispersal and survive the extinction of key species native to its original habitat.\n\nThese charming moth-like organisms feature a microscopic cluster of phytoprotein \"brain\" cells and are driven by a singular instinct to tend to their host plants.\n\nDue to a monogenic malfunction, however, this plant-tending behavior benefits all of the flora in its area <i>except</i> its own.
