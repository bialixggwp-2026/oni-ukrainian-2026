Arbor Trees have been cultivated to spread horizontally when they grow so as to produce a high yield of lumber in vertically cramped spaces.\n\nArbor Trees are related to the oak tree, specifically the Japanese Evergreen, though they have been genetically hybridized significantly.\n\nDespite having many hardy, evenly spaced branches, the short stature of the Arbor Tree makes climbing it rather irrelevant.
