The Rover is a planetary scout robot programmed to land on and mine Planetoids where sending a Duplicant would put them unneccessarily in danger.\n\nRovers are programmed to be very pleasant and social when interacting with other beings. However, an unintended consequence of this programming is that the socialized robots tended to experience the same work slow-downs due to loneliness and low morale.\n\nTo compensate for this, the Rover was programmed to have two distinct personalities it can switch between to have pleasant in-depth conversations with itself during long stints alone.
