Thermal energy can be transferred between Buildings, Creatures, World tiles, and other world entities through Conduction. Conduction occurs when two things of different Temperatures are touching. The rate of the energy transfer is the product of the averaged Conductivity values and Temperature difference. Thermal energy will flow slowly between substances with low conductivity values (insulators), and quickly between substances with high conductivity (conductors).\n\n
