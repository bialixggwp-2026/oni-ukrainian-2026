Water ice melts into liquid water when its temperature rises above its melting point. Liquid water boils into steam when its temperature rises above its boiling point. Similar transitions in state occur for most elements, but each element has its own threshold temperatures. Sometimes the transitions are not reversible - crude oil boiled into sour gas will not condense back to crude oil when cooled. Instead, the substance might condense into a totally different element with a different utility.\n\n
