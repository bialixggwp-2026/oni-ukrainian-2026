Temperature increases when the thermal energy of a substance increases. The value of temperature is equal to the total Thermal Energy divided by the Specific Heat Capacity of the substance. Because Specific Heat Capacity varies between substances so significantly, it is often the case a substance can have a higher temperature than another despite a lower overall thermal energy. This quality makes Water require nearly four times the amount of thermal energy to increase in temperature compared to Oxygen.\n\n
