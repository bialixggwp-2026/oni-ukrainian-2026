Use lighter materials, cut weight wherever possible, do widespread optimizations across the whole project.\n\nJackie: We have another option.\n\nOlivia: No. Absolutely not. You needed me and I-I came back, but if you plan to revive our research--\n\nJackie: The world's doomed regardless, Olivia. We need to use any advantage we've got... And just think about it! If we built [REDACTED] technology into the Pod it wouldn't just fix the flight problem, we'd know for a fact it would run uninterrupted for thousands of years, maybe more.\n\n[LOG ENDS]
