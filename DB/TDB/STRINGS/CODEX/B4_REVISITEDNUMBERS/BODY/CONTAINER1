And it was solved. The problem now is the insane amount of power that big thing eats every time it prints a colonist.\n\nDirector: So how do you suppose we meet these target numbers? Fossil fuels are exhausted, nuclear is outlawed, solar is next to impossible with this smog.\n\nJones: I dunno. That's why you've got researchers, I just crunch numbers. Although you should avoid fossil fuels and nuclear energy anyway. If you have to load the rocket up with a couple tons of fuel then we're back to square one on the weight problem. It's gotta be something clever.\n\nDirector: Thank you, Dr. Jones. You may go.\n\n[LOG ENDS]\n------------------\n
