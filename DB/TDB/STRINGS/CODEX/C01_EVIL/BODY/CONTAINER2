I decided to get into work early today but when I got in Nikola was already there and it looked like he hadn't been home all weekend. He was pacing back and forth in the lab, monologuing but not like an evil villain. Like someone who hadn't slept in a week.\n\n\"Ruby,\" he said. \"You have to promise me that if anything goes wrong you'll turn on this machine. They're pushing it too far. The printing pods are pushing the...It's too much - TOO MUCH! Something's going to blow. I tried... I'm trying to save it. Not the Earth.
