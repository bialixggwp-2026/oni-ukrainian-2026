Whenever I ask him what he's up to he says I wouldn't understand. Pfft! We both went through the same particle physics classes, buddy. Just because you mash a keyboard and I adjust knobs does not mean I don't know what the Time Containment Field does.\n\nAnd then today I dropped a wrench and Nikola nearly jumped out of his skin! He spun around and screamed at me never to do that again. And then when I said, \"Geez, it's not the end of the world,\" he was like, \"Yeah, it's not like the world will blow up if I get this wrong\" really sarcastic-like.\n\nWhich technically is true. If the Time Containment Field were to break down, the Temporal Bow could theoretically blow up the world. But that's why there are safety systems in place. And safety systems on safety systems. And then safety systems on top of that. But then again he built all the safety systems, so if he wanted to...\n------------------\n
