The Pikeapple Bush produces a nutritious fruit distantly related to those in the Durio genus.\n\nThose who find the Pikeapple pulp's fragrance overwhelming should consume their portion whilst standing near the plant itself; the shrubbery's gentle swaying produces a wafting effect that promotes air circulation.\n\nClosed-toe footwear is recommended, as barefoot contact with the plant's sharp seeds inevitably leads to infection.
