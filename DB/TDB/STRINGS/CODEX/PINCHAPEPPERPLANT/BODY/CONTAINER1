The Pincha Pepperplant is a tropical vine with a reduced lignin structural system that renders it incapable of growing upward from the ground.\n\nThe plant therefore prefers to embed its roots into tall trees and rocky outcrops, the result of which is an inverse of the plant's natural gravitropism, causing its stem to prefer growing downwards while the roots tend to grow up.
