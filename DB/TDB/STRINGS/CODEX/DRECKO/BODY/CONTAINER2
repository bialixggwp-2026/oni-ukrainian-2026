The tail of the Drecko, called the \"train\", is purely for decoration and can be lost or shorn without harm to the animal.\n\nAs a result, Drecko fibers are often farmed for use in textile production.\n\nCaring for Dreckos is a fulfilling endeavor thanks to their companionable personalities.\n\nSome domestic Dreckos have even been known to respond to their own names.
