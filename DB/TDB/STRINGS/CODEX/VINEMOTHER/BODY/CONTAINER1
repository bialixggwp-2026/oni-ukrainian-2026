Ovagros are resilient plants with highly efficient nutrient storage and redistribution systems. A healthy node produces many times the amount of energy that it requires. This is used to fuel the growth of exploratory vines that expand onto the surrounding territory.\n\nVines are entirely reliant on the node for nutrients. Each vine features hooked thorns that protect unripe fruit and act as crampons enabling the vine to use any empty surface as a trellis. They also make vine removal a tedious task.
