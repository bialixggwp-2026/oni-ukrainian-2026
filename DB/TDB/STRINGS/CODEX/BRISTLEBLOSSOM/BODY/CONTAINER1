The Bristle Blossom is frequently cultivated for its calorie dense and relatively fast growing Bristle Berries.\n\nConsumption of the berry requires special preparation due to the thick barbs surrounding the edible fruit.\n\nThe term \"Bristle Berry\" is, in fact, a misnomer, as it is not a \"berry\" by botanical definition but an aggregate fruit made up of many smaller fruitlets.
