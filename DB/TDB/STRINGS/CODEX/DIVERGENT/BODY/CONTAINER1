'Divergent' is the name given to the two different genders of one species, the Sweetle and the Grubgrub, both of which are able to reproduce asexually and tend to Grubfruit Plants.\n\nWhen tending to the Grubfruit Plant, both gender variants of the Divergent display the exact same behaviors, however the Grubgrub possesses slightly more tiny facial hair which helps in pollinating the plants and stimulates faster growth.
