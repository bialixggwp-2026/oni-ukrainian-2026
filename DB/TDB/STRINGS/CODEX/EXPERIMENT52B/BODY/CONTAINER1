Experiment 52B is an aggressive, yet sessile creature that produces 5 kilograms of sap per 1000 kcal it consumes.\n\nDuplicants would do well to maintain a safe distance when delivering food to Experiment 52B.\n\nWhile this creature may look like a tree, its taxonomy more closely resembles a giant land-based coral with cybernetic implants.\n\nAlthough normally lab-grown creatures would be given a better name than Experiment 52B, in this particular case the experimenting scientists weren't sure that they were done.
