[LOG BEGINS]\n\nDirector: Temporal energy can be reconfigured to vibrate the matter constituting Neutronium at just the right frequency to break it down and disperse it.\n\nDirector: However, it is difficult to stabilize and maintain this reconfigured energy long enough to effectively remove practical amounts of Neutronium in real-life scenarios.\n\nDirector: I am looking into making this technology more reliable and compact - this data could potentially have uses in the development of some sort of all-purpose disintegration ray.\n\n[END LOG]
