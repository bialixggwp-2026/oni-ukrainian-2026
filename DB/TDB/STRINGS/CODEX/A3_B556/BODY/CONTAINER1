I've been so tired lately. I've probably spent the last 3 nights sleeping at my desk, and I've used the lab's safety shower to bathe twice already this month.\n\nWe're technically on schedule, but for some reason Director Stern has been breathing down my neck to get these new products ready for market.\n\nNormally I'd be mad about the added pressure on my work, but something in the Director's voice tells me that time is of the essence.\n------------------\n
