I got home yesterday fully intending to work on my paper after Broussard sent me home, but the second I walked in the door I hit the pillow and didn't get back up. I slept for <i>12 straight hours</i>.\n\nI had no idea I needed that. When I got into the lab this morning I looked over my work from the past few weeks, and realized it's completely useless.\n\nIt'll take me hours to correct all the mistakes I made these past few months. Is this what I was killing myself for? I'm such a rube, I owe Broussard a huge thanks.\n\nI'll start keeping more regular hours from now on... Also, I was considering maybe getting a dog.
