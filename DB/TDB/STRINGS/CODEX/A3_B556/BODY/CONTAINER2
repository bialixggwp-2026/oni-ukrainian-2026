I keep finding myself staring at my computer screen, totally unable to remember what it was I was doing.\n\nI try to force myself to type up some notes or analyze my data but it's like my brain is paralyzed, I can't get anything done.\n\nI'll have to stay late to make up for all this time I've wasted staying late.\n------------------\n
