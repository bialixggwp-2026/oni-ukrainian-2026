Dr. Broussard told me I looked half dead and sent me home today. I don't think she even has the authority to do that, but I did as I was told. She wasn't messing around if you know what I mean.\n\nI can probably get a head start on my paper from home today, anyway.\n\nI think I have an idea for a circuit configuration that will improve the battery life of all our technologies by a whole 2.3%.\n------------------\n
