The signals of sensor wires can be combined using special buildings called \"Gates\" in order to create complex activation conditions.\nThe <link=\"LOGICGATEAND\">AND Gate</link> can have two automation wires connected to its input slots, and one connected to its output slots. It will send a \"Green\" signal to its output slot only if it is receiving a \"Green\" signal from both its input slots. This could be used to activate a building only when multiple sensors are detecting something.\n\n
