There are two signals that an <link=\"LOGICWIRE\">Automation Wire</link> can send: Green and Red. The green signal will usually cause buildings to turn on, and the red signal will usually cause buildings to turn off. Sensors can often be configured to send their green signal only under certain conditions. A <link=\"LOGICTEMPERATURESENSOR\">Thermo Sensor</link> could be configured to only send a green signal if detecting temperatures greater than a chosen value.\n\n
