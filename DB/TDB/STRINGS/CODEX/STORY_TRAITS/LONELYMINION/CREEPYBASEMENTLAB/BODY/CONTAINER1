Where's the geneticist?\n\nB083: In the bathroom-\n\nB997: He went home.\n\n[long pause]\n\nB997: It's the holidays. He has a family.\n\nA216: We all do. That's exactly why this project is so urgent.\n\nB997: It's not our fault this stuff sat in a subterranean ocean for a year, and took another year to get back to Earth! The microbe samples didn't fare well on the journey, and most of the mechanical components are completely corroded. There's not much to-\n\nB083: -we're analyzing it all and salvaging what we can, Jea- ...Dr. Saruhashi.\n\nA216: Good. And take down those ridiculous lights. This is a lab, not a retro \"shopping mall.\"\n\n[LOG ENDS]\n------------------\n[LOG BEGINS]\n\nB577: Thanks for getting all the debris packed up for disposal.\n\nB997: I thought you did that.\n\nB577: No, I-\n\nB083: Who took my sandwich?\n\nB997: Not this again.\n\nB577: Ren, did you load the shipping container?\n\nB083: Seriously, I haven't eaten in thirteen hours. This isn't funny.\n\nB997: It's a little funny.\n\nB577: Can we focus, please?\n\nB997: Nobody took your sandwich, Rock Doc.\n\nB083: Then why does my food keep going missing?\n\nB997: Maybe the lab ghost took it. Or maybe you just shouldn't leave it out overnight. Gunderson probably thought it was garbage.\n\nB083: He doesn't even clean down here!\n\nB997: Right. Because if he did, I wouldn't have to keep sweeping up the magnesium sulfate deposits that <i>someone</i> keeps tracking all over the floor between shifts.\n\nB083: It's not me!\n\nB577: Listen, I know we're all tired and things have been a little strange. But the sooner we get this sent up to the launchpad, the sooner it starts its trip to the sun and we can all get out of this creepy sub-sub-basement.\n\nB083: Fine.\n\nB997: Fine.\n\nB083: Fine!\n\n[LOG ENDS]\n------------------\n
