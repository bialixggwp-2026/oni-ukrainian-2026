Hey kiddo,\n\nWe missed you at your cousin's wedding last weekend. The gift was nice, but the dance floor felt empty without you.\n\nDariush sends his love. He's really turned a corner since he started eating those gooey pudding things you sent over. Any chance you have a version that doesn't smell like feet?\n\nCome home sometime when you're not so busy.\n\n- Baba\n------------------\n
