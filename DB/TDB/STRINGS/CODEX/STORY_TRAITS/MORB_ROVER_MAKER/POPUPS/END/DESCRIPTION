Success! My Duplicants' efforts to get the Biobot Builder up and running have finally paid off!\n\nOur first fully assembled P.E.G.G.Y. biobot is ready to perform tasks in hazardous environments, which means less exposure to danger for my Duplicants. There seems to be no limit to the number of biobots that we could produce.\n\nA small toy bot was found discarded behind the Sporb tank. It occasionally plays a deteriorated laugh track.
