<indent=5%>Dear [REDACTED]\n\nWe are pleased to announce that research objectives for Operation Piazzi's Planet are nearing completion. Thank you all for your patience as we navigated the unprecedented obstacles that such groundbreaking work entails.\n\nWe are aware of rumors regarding documents leaked from Dr. [REDACTED]'s files.\n\nRest assured that the contents of this supposed \"whistleblower\" effort are entirely fabricated—our technology is far too advanced to allow for the type of miscalculation that would result in OPP shipments arriving at their destination some 10,000 years prior to the targeted date.\n\nOur IT security team is currently investigating the document's digital footprint to determine its origin.\n\nTo express our gratitude for your continued support, we would like to invite key stakeholders to a private launch party held at the Gravitas Facility. The evening will be emceed by Dr. Olivia Broussard, who will present our groundbreaking prototypes along with a five-course meal featuring lab-crafted ingredients.\n\nDue to the sensitive nature of our work, we regret that no additional guests or dietary restrictions can be accommodated at this time.\n\nDirector Stern will be hosting a 30-minute Q&A session after dinner. Questions must be submitted at least 24 hours in advance.\n\nQueries about the [REDACTED] papers will be disregarded.\n\nPlease be advised that the contents of this e-mail will expire three minutes from the time of opening.</indent>
