<smallcaps>[Voice Recognition Initialized]\n[Subject Identified: B363]</smallcaps>\n\n[LOG BEGINS]\n\n...Restricting our organism design to specifically target survival in an off-planet polar climate has narrowed our focus significantly, allowing development of this project to rapidly outpace the others.\n\nWe have successfully optimized for adaptive features such as the formation of protective adipose tissue at >40% of the organism's total mass. Dr. Bubare was concerned about the consequences for muscle mass, but results confirm that reductions fall within an acceptable range.\n\nOur next step is to adapt the organism's diet. It would be inadvisable to populate a new colony with carnivorous creatures of this size.\n\n[LOG ENDS]\n------------------\n[LOG BEGINS]\n\n...When I am alone in the lab, I find myself gravitating toward the enclosure to listen to the creature's melodic vocalizations. Sometimes the pitch changes slightly as I approach.\n\nI am not certain what that means.\n\n[LOG ENDS]\n------------------\n
