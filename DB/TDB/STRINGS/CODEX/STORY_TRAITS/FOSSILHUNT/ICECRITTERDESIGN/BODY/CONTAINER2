[LOG BEGINS]\n\n...Some of the other departments have taken to calling our work here \"Project Meat Popsicle\". It is a crass misnomer. This species is not designed to be a food source: it must survive the Ceres climate long enough to establish a stable population that will enable the subsequent settlement party to access the essential research data stored in its DNA via Dr. Winslow's revolutionary genome-encoding technique.\n\nImagine, countless yottabytes' worth of scientific documentation wandering freely around a new colony...the ultimate self-sustaining archive, providing stable data storage that requires zero technological maintenance.\n\nIt gives new meaning to the term, \"living document.\"\n\n[LOG ENDS]\n------------------\n[LOG BEGINS]\n\n...Today is the day. My sonorous critter and her handful of progeny are ready to be transported to their new home. They are scheduled to arrive three months in the past, to ensure that they are well established before the settlement party's arrival next week.\n\nDr. Techna invited me to assist with the teleportation. I was relieved to be too busy to accept. I have heard rumors about previous shipments going awry. These stories are unsubstantiated, and yet...\n\nThe urgency of our mission sometimes necessitates non-ideal compromises.\n\nThe lab is so very quiet now.\n\n[LOG ENDS]\n------------------\n
