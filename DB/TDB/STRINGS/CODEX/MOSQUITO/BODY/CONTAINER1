The Gnit is an insectoid critter that relies on supplementary nutrients and minerals from Duplicants and other critters to mitigate the outsized energy requirements of its reproductive system.\n\nGnits' antennae double as maxillary palps equipped with finely tuned olfactory receptor neurons that enable them to pinpoint nutrient sources from a great distance.\n\nThese same receptors activate the insectoid's flight response upon detecting certain changes in an organism's respiration, such as the sharp intake of breath that precedes a fatal counter-attack.
