Pufts often have a collection of asymmetric teeth lining the ridge of their mouths, although this feature is entirely vestigial as Pufts do not consume solid food.\n\nInstead, a baleen-like mesh of keratin at the back of the Puft's throat works to filter out tiny organisms and food particles from the air.\n\nUnusable air is expelled back out the Puft's posterior trunk, along with waste material and any indigestible particles or pathogens which it then evacuates as solid biomass.
