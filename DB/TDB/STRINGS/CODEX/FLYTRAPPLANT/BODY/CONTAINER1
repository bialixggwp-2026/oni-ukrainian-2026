Lura Plants are carnivorous flowers with ribbon-like anthers that detect the presence of airborne critters within trapping range.\n\nThe Lura's petals are covered in fine, hollow hairs that immobilize prey and ensure even distribution of digestive enzymes. The only part of a critter that the plant cannot fully digest is the exoskeleton, which irritate its mucous membrane.\n\nLiquefied exoskeletal remains are flushed from the plant as needed.
