<smallcaps>[Voice Recognition Initialized]\n[Subject Identified: A001]</smallcaps>\n\n[LOG BEGINS]\n\nDr. Techna's newest notes on Duplicant memories have revealed some interesting discoveries. It seems memories <i>can</i> be transferred to the cloned subject but it requires the host to be subjected to a machine that performs extremely detailed microanalysis. This in-depth dissection of the subject would produce the results we need but at the expense of destroying the host.\n\nOf course this is not ideal for our current situation. The time and energy it took to recruit Gravitas' highly trained staff would be wasted if we were to extirpate these people for the sake of experimentation. But perhaps we can use our Duplicants as experimental subjects until we perfect the process and look into finding volunteers for the future in order to obtain an ideal specimen. I will have to discuss this with Dr. Techna but I'm sure he would be enthusiastic about such an opportunity to continue his work.\n\nI am also very interested in the commercial opportunities this presents. Off the top of my head I can think of applications in genetics, AI development, and teleportation technology. This could be a significant financial windfall for the company.\n\n[LOG ENDS]
