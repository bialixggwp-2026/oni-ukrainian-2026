Mealwood is an bramble-like plant that has a parasitic symbiotic relationship with the nutrient-rich Meal Lice that inhabit it.\n\nMealwood experience a rapid growth rate in its first stages, but once the Meal Lice become active they consume all the new fruiting spurs on the plant before they can fully mature.\n\nTheoretically the flowers of this plant are a beautiful color of fuchsia, however no Mealwood has ever reached the point of flowering without being overrun by the parasitic Meal Lice.
