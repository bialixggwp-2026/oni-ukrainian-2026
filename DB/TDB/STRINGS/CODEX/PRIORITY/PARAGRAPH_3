The priority of errands can often be modified using the <b>Priority tool</b> {Hotkey/Prioritize}. The values applied by this tool are always less influential than the Errand Type priorities described above. If two errands with equal Errand Type Priority are available to a Duplicant, they will choose the errand with a higher priority setting as applied by the tool.\n\n
