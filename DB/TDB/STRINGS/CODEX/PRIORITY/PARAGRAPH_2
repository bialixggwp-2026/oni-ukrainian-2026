Each errand a Duplicant can perform falls into an Errand Category. These categories can be prioritized on a per-Duplicant basis in the <b>Priorities Screen</b>. Entire errand categories can also be prohibited to a Duplicant if they are meant to never perform errands of that variety. A common configuration is to assign errand type priority based on Duplicant attributes.\n\nFor example, Duplicants who are good at Research could be made to prioritize the Researching errand type. Duplicants with poor Athletics could be made to deprioritize the Supplying and Storing errand types.\n\n
