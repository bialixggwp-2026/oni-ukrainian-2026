Tame critters have significantly faster metabolism than wild ones, and get hungry sooner. This makes them more valuable in terms of resource production, as long as the colony is equipped to meet their dietary needs.\n\nCritters' stomachs vary in size, but they are capable of storing at least five cycles' worth of food. Their bellies begin to rumble when those internal caches drop below 90 percent. The critter will then seek out food, and will continue to eat until they feel completely full again.\n\nJuvenile critters have the slowest metabolism, although glum tame critters are not far behind.
