Wild critters do not require feeding by the colony's Critter Ranchers, thanks to their slower metabolism. They do, however, produce fewer materials than domesticated critters.\n\nApproaching a wild critter to trap or wrangle it is quite safe, provided that it is a non-hostile species. Attacking a critter will typically provoke a combat response.
