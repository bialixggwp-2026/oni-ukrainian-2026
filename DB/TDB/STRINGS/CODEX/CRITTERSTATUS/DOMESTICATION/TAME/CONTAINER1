Domesticated critters produce far more resources and lay eggs at a higher frequency than wild ones. They require additional care in order to maintain the levels of happiness that maximize their utility in the colony. (Happy critters are also generally more pleasant to be around.)\n\nOnce tame, critters can access the Critter Feeder, which is unavailable to wild critters.
