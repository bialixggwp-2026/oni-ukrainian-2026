A critter's incubation time is one-fifth of their total lifetime: for example, if a critter's maximum age is 100 cycles, its egg will take 20 cycles to hatch.\n\nIncubation rates can be accelerated through tender intervention by a Critter Rancher. Lullabied eggs—that is, those that have been sung to—will incubate faster and hatch sooner than eggs that have not received such tender care. Being cuddled by a Cuddle Pip also accelerates the rate of incubation.\n\nEggs can be cuddled anywhere, but can only be lullabied when placed inside an Incubator. The effects of lullabies and cuddles are cumulative.
