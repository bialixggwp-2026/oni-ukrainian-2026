With the exception of the Morb—which can live indefinitely if left to its own devices—critters have a fixed life expectancy. The maximum age indicates the highest number of cycles that critters will live, barring starvation or other unnatural causes of death.\n\nBabyhood, the period before a critter is mature enough to reproduce, is marked by a slower metabolism and the easy happiness of youth.\n\nMost species live for 75 to 100 cycles on average.
