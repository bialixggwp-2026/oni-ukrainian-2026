With the exception of the Beeta Hive and the Morb—which can live indefinitely if left to their own devices—critters have a fixed life expectancy. The maximum age indicates the highest number of cycles that critters will live, barring starvation or other unnatural causes of death.\n\nIf critters are injured or unhealthy, a Critter Rancher can restore their health at the Grooming Station.\n\nBabyhood, the period before a critter is mature enough to reproduce, is marked by a slower metabolism and the easy happiness of youth.\n\nMost species live for 75 to 100 cycles on average. The shortest-lived critter is the Beeta, whose lifespan is only five cycles long.
