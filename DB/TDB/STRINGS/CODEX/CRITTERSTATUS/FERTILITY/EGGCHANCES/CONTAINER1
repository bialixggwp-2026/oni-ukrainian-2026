In most cases, an egg will hatch into the same critter variant as its parent. Genetic volatility, however, means that there is a chance that it may hatch into another variant from that species.\n\nThere are many things that can alter the likelihood of a critter laying a particular type of egg.\n\nEgg chances are impacted by:\n    • Diet\n    • Body temperature\n    • Ambient gasses and elements\n    • Plants in the critters' care\n    • Variants that share the enclosure\n\nWhen a tame critter lays an egg, the resulting offspring will be born tame.
