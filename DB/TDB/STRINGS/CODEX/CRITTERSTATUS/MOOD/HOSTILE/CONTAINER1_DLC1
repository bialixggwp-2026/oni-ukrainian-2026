Most critters are non-hostile. They may attempt to defend themselves when attacked by Duplicants, though their natural passivity limits the damage caused in these instances.\n\nSome critters, however, have exceptionally strong self-preservation instincts and must be approached with extreme caution. Pokeshells, for example, are not naturally hostile but are fiercely protective of their young and will attack if a Duplicant or critter wanders too close to their eggs.\n\nThe Beeta, on the other hand, is both hostile and radioactive. While it cannot be tamed, it can be subdued through the use of CO2.
