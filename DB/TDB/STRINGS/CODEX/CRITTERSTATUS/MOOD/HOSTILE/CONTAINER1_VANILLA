Most critters are non-hostile. They may attempt to defend themselves when attacked by Duplicants, though their natural passivity limits the damage caused in these instances.\n\nSome critters, however, have exceptionally strong self-preservation instincts and must be approached with extreme caution.\n\nPokeshells, for example, are not naturally hostile but are fiercely protective of their young and will attack if a Duplicant or critter wanders too close to their eggs.
