As with many living things, critters are susceptible to fluctuations in mood. While they are incapable of articulating their feelings verbally, these variations have observable effects on productivity and reproduction.\n\nFactors that influence a critter's mood include: grooming, wildness/tameness, habitat, overcrowding, confinement, and Brackene consumption.
