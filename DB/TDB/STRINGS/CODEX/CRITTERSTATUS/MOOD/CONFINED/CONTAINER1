Each species has its own space requirements. Critters who find themselves in a room that they consider too small will feel confined. They will feel the same way if they become stuck in a door or tile. Critters will not reproduce while they are in this state.\n\nShove Voles are the exception to this rule: their tunneling instincts make them quite comfortable in snug spaces, and they never feel confined.
