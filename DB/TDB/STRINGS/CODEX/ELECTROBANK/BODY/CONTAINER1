Power Banks are portable <link=\"POWER\">Power</link> storage containers that can be used to supply electricity to mobile entities and isolated areas.\n\nSingle-use power banks are easier to produce, but rechargeable and self-charging models are more efficient in the long run.\n\nCautious handling is required, as liquid exposure (or expiration, for self-charging power banks) can lead to explosions.
