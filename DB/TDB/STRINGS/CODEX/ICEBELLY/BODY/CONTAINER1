The Bammoth is one of the oldest species on record, with ancient skeletal remains dating back approximately 10,000 years.\n\nThis placid herbivore is known for its unique body language: an angry young Bammoth expresses displeasure by flopping down dramatically in front of its opponent, while older creatures with limited mobility will sit facing away from the source of their annoyance.\n\nLicking the ground in front of a caregiver can be a sign of either deep affection or mineral deficiency.
