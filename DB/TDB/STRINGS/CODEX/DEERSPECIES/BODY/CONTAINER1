Evenly distributed throughout the Flox's dense overcoat are countless vibrissae-like hairs that transmit detailed sensory information about its environment, allowing it to detect changes as subtle as the shift in another creature's mood.\n\nFloxes avoid overstimulation by whipping their tails to release the pent-up energy. Because these tactile hairs are so sensitive, they cannot be safely shorn.\n\nFlox antlers, however, are nerveless and cumbersome. Handlers who unburden them of this cranial load are often rewarded with the critter's long, slow blinks of contentment.
