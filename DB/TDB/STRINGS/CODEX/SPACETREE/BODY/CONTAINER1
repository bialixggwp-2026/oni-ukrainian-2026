The Bonbon Tree is a towering plant developed to thrive in below-freezing temperatures. It features multiple independently functioning branches that synthesize bright light to funnel nutrients into a hollow central core.\n\nOnce the tree is fully grown, the core secretes digestive enzymes that break down surplus nutrients and store them as thick, sweet fluid. This can be refined into <link=\"SUCROSE\">Sucrose</link> for the production of higher-tier foods, or used as-is to sustain Spigot Seal ranches.\n\nBonbon Trees are generally considered an eyesore, and would likely be eradicated if not for their delicious output.
