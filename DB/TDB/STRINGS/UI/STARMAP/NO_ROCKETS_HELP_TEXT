Rockets allow you to visit nearby celestial bodies.\n\nEach rocket must have a Command Module, an Engine, and Fuel.\n\nYou can also carry other modules that allow you to gather specific resources from the places you visit.\n\nRemember the more weight a rocket has, the more limited it'll be on the distance it can travel. You can add more fuel to fix that, but fuel will add weight as well.
