Geysers and Fumaroles emit elements at variable intervals. They provide a sustainable source of material, albeit in typically low volumes.\n\nThe variable factors of a geyser are:\n\n    • Emission element \n    • Emission temperature \n    • Emission mass \n    • Cycle length \n    • Dormancy duration \n    • Disease emitted
