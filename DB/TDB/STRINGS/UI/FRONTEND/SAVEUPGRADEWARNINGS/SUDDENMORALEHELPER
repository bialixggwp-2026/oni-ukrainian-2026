Welcome to the Expressive Upgrade! This update introduces a new Morale system that replaces Food and Decor Expectations that were found in previous versions of the game.\n\nThe game you are trying to load was created before this system was introduced, and will need to be updated. You may either:\n\n\n1) Enable the new Morale system in this save, removing Food and Decor Expectations. It's possible that when you load your save your old colony won't meet your Duplicants' new Morale needs, so they'll receive a 5 cycle Morale boost to give you time to adjust.\n\n2) Disable Morale in this save. The new Morale mechanics will still be visible, but won't affect your Duplicants' stress. Food and Decor expectations will no longer exist in this save.
