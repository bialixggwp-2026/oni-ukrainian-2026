Records from the Genetics and Biology Lab of the Gravitas facility show that several early iterations of a radioactive Bee would continue to produce honey and that this honey was once accidentally stored in the employee kitchen which resulted in several incidents of minor radiation poisoning when it was erroneously labled as a sweetener for tea.\n\nEmployees who used this product reported that it was the \"sweetest honey they'd ever tasted\" and expressed no regret at the mix-up.
