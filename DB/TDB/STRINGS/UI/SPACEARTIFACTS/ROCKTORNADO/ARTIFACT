Speculations about the origin of this rock include a paper written by one Harold P. Moreson, Ph.D. in which he theorized it could be a rare form of hollow geode which failed to form any crystals inside.\n\nThis paper appears in the Gravitas archives, and in all probability, was one of the factors in the hiring of Moreson into the Geology department of the company.
