The amount of Neutronium present in this teapot suggests that it has crossed the threshold of the spacetime continuum on countless occasions, floating through many multiple universes over a plethora of times and spaces.\n\nThough there are, theoretically, an infinite amount of outcomes to any one event over many multi-verses, the homogeneity of the still relatively young multiverse suggests that this is then not the only teapot which has crossed into multiple universes. Despite the infinite possible outcomes of infinite multiverses it appears one high probability constant is that there is, or once was, a teapot floating somewhere in space within every universe.
