<b>Errand Proximity Settings</b>\n\nEnabling Proximity settings tells my Duplicants to always choose the closest, most urgent errand to perform.\n\nWhen disabled, Duplicants will choose between two high priority errands based on a hidden priority hierarchy instead.\n\nEnabling Proximity helps cut down on travel time in areas with lots of high priority errands, and is useful for large colonies.
